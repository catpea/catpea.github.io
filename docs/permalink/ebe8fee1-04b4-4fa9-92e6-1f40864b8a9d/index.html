          <div class="card-text post-content p-3">
            <p>In my teenage days I’ve noticed,
a strange and mysterious little path running along the i-275 highway in Michigan.</p>
<p>It is so small compared to the Highway,
that to this day looks silly.</p>
<p>I then set of on great many Michigan adventures,
and one time upon my return from camping at little Nordhouse Wilderness.</p>
<p>I just started missing nature and adventure,
and I couldn&#39;t go back to Nordhouse…</p>
<p>Because I camped there for sixty days or something like that,
and the raccoons almost elected me as their leader and protector.</p>
<hr>
<p>So I remembered an ancient bicycle, that came from some garage sale,
and looked really expensive, it said it was made from aluminum – OK!?</p>
<p>So, I got on it, threw a load of bread in my backpack,
and bushwhacked my way to that little road.</p>
<p>Days before, I was jogging in the area, and figured,
might as well try to shuffle on that litter road.</p>
<p>That&#39;s when my foot sank in a foot of mud,
and I had to hop to the little road, to dry my socks.</p>
<p>While my socks were drying, I did some detective work,
and it turned out the silly litter road is called the i275 Bicycle Trail.</p>
<p>So now that I had a bicycle it made sense to bicycle on it,
hours later, I made it to some distant park may 20 miles away, or more.</p>
<p>And my pedal started squeaking, really badly, then I lost pressure in my tire,
from a little wire, and had to walk home three miles.</p>
<p>I abandoned the bicycle on a rest area, because after dragging it for two miles,
the inner tube came out, and I had no idea what to do.</p>
<p>I had no tools, nothing to repair the tire with,
I didn’t know where to begin.</p>
<hr>
<p>I drove to the rest area, got my bicycle, got a tire repair kit from a supermarket,
and followed the instructions.</p>
<p>Next I took my awesome bicycle to a bicycle repair shop,
to figure out the squeaking problem, and why the pedals were wobbly.</p>
<p>The man said he can replace the pedal assembly,
but I could read his behavior, and asked.</p>
<p>“Is this a cheap bicycle?” Yes! He almost yelled out,
it seemed that he’s been holding it in like gas.</p>
<p>The repairs would cost as much as a new bicycle,
what I had, was the cheapest kind of bicycle, and it was way too small for me, even.</p>
<p>But I didn’t know,
I loved anyway.</p>
<hr>
<p>I started riding a mountain bike, and it was large,
it was long, but it turned out to have too many moving parts.</p>
<p>Things were always a little off,
it is still a good bicycle, it is still around.</p>
<p>But, I stared tiding a $135 dollar fat tire bike,
it has one gear, and you trigger the breaks by moving the pedals back a little bit.</p>
<p>And it is really hard to lose balance because those tires are heavy,
and they really want to turn, just forward.</p>
<p>Fat tire bikes,
almost ride themselves.</p>
<p>Despite the stability, I did end up falling from the bicycle,
I am a natural born sea captain – commanding old-timey tall ships is in my blood.</p>
<p>So when I ride a bicycle, I use the terms port-side and starboard,
instead of saying left and right like a normal person.</p>
<p>And actually notifying the person ahead of me that I am about to pass them,
on the left.</p>
<p>Because I am drunk from the power that the command of my bicycle bestows upon me,
I often use the terms interchangeably.</p>
<p>Knowing that people don’t know what the hell I am saying anyways,
I use the word starboard, even when I am passing on the left – it is such a pretty word.</p>
<p>And I developed a habit, of dumping all my weight on my left pedal,
and actually standing on my bicycle like a proper captain.</p>
<p>Well, I went in a fast food joint by a gas station for a Ice Frappe,
and on my way out...</p>
<p>I either stepped into a cleaning solution,
or some car oil in the parking lot.</p>
<p>Not a minute later, with all my weight on that one pedal,
my foot slipped.</p>
<p>I went from a proud captain, in charge of the sea of asphalt,
to a stupid 280 pound bird about to kiss it.</p>
<p>I went flying through the air at seven miles per hour, flapping his wings,
with the bicycle now intricately interwoven between the two of my legs.</p>
<p>I skinned my elbow like a nine year old boy,
but quickly got up, without crying.</p>
<p>As a side note by other trick as a more muscular nugget now,
is bouncing down the stairs, hitting all 12 of them, and feeling fine.</p>
<p>Well, certainly awake,
stairs are actually my only fear.</p>
<hr>
<p>Just today, I replaced the pedals, now worn rubber,
with aluminum that has screws crudely driven through it.</p>
<p>There is no possibility of slipping of that pedal now,
but those screws are much to pointy in an area where the legs generally go.</p>
<p>Previously I replaced the seat,
my bicycle trail adventures last the whole day.</p>
<p>And that seat was just for making a few loops
and presumably popping a wheelie, or something.</p>
<p>I went to the supermarket again,
and got a seat for large and plump bottoms -  now, it feels like sitting on a sofa.</p>
<p>If you are just starting to ride your bicycle,
get the big seat, don’t worry if your bicycle looks odd.</p>
<p>Those other seats require few bruised days of getting butt bone used to it,
just find a large comfy seat.</p>
<hr>
<p>Remember, whatever can go wrong will go wrong,
so you must always have a bike tire repair kit with you.</p>
<p>As as big of an air pump as you can find,
the little ones are flimsy and cheap, they may bend or come apart.</p>
<p>And all the tools you use for poking around your bicycle,
must come with you as well.</p>
<p>I bought a handlebar bag for just the tools,
and that’s also where I mounted my air pump, beneath the handlebars.</p>
<p>If you can patch and inflate the tire,
and screw whatever came unscrewed, your bike will always bong you home.</p>
<p>You may need a bit of grease as well, maybe a little can of that WD stuff,
these two will help with squeaky things.</p>
<p>For the last three years or so, I had a dollop of a moisturizing sunblock,
in one of my squeaky pedal handles, a little bit of grease goes a long way.</p>
<hr>
<p>As to weather, usually, before it rains, you find a spot to wait it out,
you can wear a poncho, but it best to wait it out.</p>
<p>Mud however, is different kind of problem,
your back tire will actually throw mud at your back.</p>
<p>And your front tire, even on a sunny day,
can send a little pebble at your face.</p>
<p>So you will need mud guards,
the universal flimsy ones are just fine.</p>
<p>They just need to stop little bits of dirt,
and watery mud.</p>
<hr>
<p>You will need plain transparent plastic glasses,
to prevent bugs and dust and tree bits from flying into eyes.</p>
<p>I never ride without eye protection, in my experience,
it takes little more than 30 minutes…</p>
<p>For a stupid fly,
to try die in your eye.</p>
<p>Don’t ride without glasses,
they cost nothing, and will keep your eyes perfectly safe.</p>
<p>And you will need bug-spray,
you don’t have to spray yourself ahead of time…</p>
<p>Just if you need to stop,
to repair something.</p>
<p>I am yet to become wise enough to wear a helmet,
in part because my fat tire bike is just super slow.</p>
<p>But I totally plan to wear one,
as motorists can’t really see you – nor should you trust them to see you.</p>
<p>Get some neat blinking lights,
and a proper helmet.</p>
<p>Please, be safe,
and drink plenty of water.</p>
