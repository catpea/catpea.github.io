            <p>Your body is a finely tuned machine,
my doctor always says “coffee is good for you”, but it is not.</p>
<p>There are only two sources of energy food,
and fresh songs that make you want to dance.</p>
<p>Coffee will make you cross boundaries your body prefers you don’t cross,
it is not nutrition, it is forcing your body to do something it does not want to do.</p>
<p>Not only will you be energized at wrong times of day relative to your schedule,
you will also be tired at wrong times of day.</p>
<hr>
<p>You get no shortcuts, you can’t cheat your body into a workout,
just like you can’t just start painting masterpieces.</p>
<p>Respect your sleep schedule,
let it stabile by waking up at the same time.</p>
<p>And then honor it,
you may still need a jolt of energy, but you must honor the schedule your body sets.</p>
<p>That puts you into the real energy zone,
you are resting correctly, doing what your body expects you to do.</p>
<p>You can’t cheat a great ape that evolved for 4 billion years,
with a bean, you need sleep, rest, health.</p>
<hr>
<p>Once you stop sabotaging your body with coffee,
and a stupid sleep schedule.</p>
<p>You need to remember that you have superpowers,
you are an adaptive biomechanical machine.</p>
<p>That means, you can slowly, at the speed that your body allows,
raise your endurance, precisely, like joggers do it.</p>
<p>Start slow, eliminate rest, celebrate, go faster,
adapt some more.</p>
<hr>
<p>For bodybuilding, you don’t focus on speed of jogging,
you focus on weighing your self down.</p>
<p>You do that by carrying dumbbells in your hands,
you will trip and fall, make sure the dumbbell plates protect your fingers.</p>
<p>You can continue increasing your dumbell weight,
if you only go up by 2.5 pounds.</p>
<p>The 5 pound gap that we see at the gym is too wide,
you can’t go up by a total of 10 pounds, 5 pounds is the maximum.</p>
<p>Please be responsible and respectful to your body,
and use wrist weights making the gap even smaller.</p>
<p>Go from five pounds per hand,
to six or six and a half, and then sever and a half.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can clearly see,
how that will keep you going.</p>
<hr>
<p>Once it becomes too cold, or your dumbbells become too heavy and dangerous,
you sign up for the gym.</p>
<p>You begin working out with young lads who perfume themselves to smell nice,
use the same toilets that seem to be used by unclean local fat ass hobos too.</p>
<p>And you will discover, that not a single elderly who is always cold,
puts on a shirt, they they instead demand that the entire area is heated.</p>
<p>What feels warm for the elderly, is scorching heat for the endurance bodybuilder,
so water is next, urine must be light green.</p>
<p>You weigh yourself before a workout,  and right after,
to figure out how much electrolyte water you lost, and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Life is dangerous, couch is dangerous,
workouts are dangerous.</p>
<hr>
<p>Don’t go too fast, study yourself,
earn body wisdom, or you will hurt yourself.</p>
<p>Two years ago one gentleman was spending too much time working on his back,
it just didn’t seem right.</p>
<p>I told him to stop, it maybe easy, but it just does not seem right,
I told him to light light and long.</p>
<p>And he did hurt his back, and needed a procedure, a small surgery,
I suspect he does not come to the gym as often now.</p>
<p>He learned his wisdom the hard way,
doing it wrong is not worth it.</p>
<hr>
<p>To support endurance bodybuilding,
which is converting your jogging into a light but dynamic dance.</p>
<p>You will need hiker food,
nuts, dried fruit, seeds.</p>
<p>You can blend it into a protein shake,
or soak it in hot water, so that you don’t endanger your teeth or dental work.</p>
<p>The rest of your meals, are as perfected as the hiker food,
this time by farmers, meals that inspire military food as well.</p>
<p>Few candies, a bit of coffee, meat, bean, vegetables,
farmer food.</p>
<p>Farmers, had to work hard to survive,
they have finely tuned their diets for long lasting energy.</p>
<hr>
<p>I recently learned that the lady at the front desk in my Doctor’s office,
eats a single vitamin, same one I discovered too by going over labels of energy drinks.</p>
<p>She said she takes B vitamin in the morning,
we aren’t sure if it is placebo effect ort not,.</p>
<p>But, multivitamins will contain Zinc and Magnesium,
and if you find a pill bottle with that, it will warn you to take it before sleep.</p>
<p>Those of you who have been taking vitamins in the morning,
have been putting yourselves to sleep at noon.</p>
<p>Another reason why coffee is trouble,
people will try to drink coffee not understanding…</p>
<p>That electrolytes are helping them recover,
by sending them to bed.</p>
<p>B vitamin in the morning,
multivitamins in the late afternoon.</p>
<hr>
<p>At the gym, you will need to synchronize your motion to music,
one beat up, next beat down.</p>
<p>Cycle your standing dumbbell exercises,
so that you never need to stop, as different muscle groups rest.</p>
<p>And you will not only need fresh music,
that actually makes you dance, makes you want to do fluid motions.</p>
<p>But you need to move away from distractions,
because you will not be able to keep going if you can’t enter a dance trance.</p>
<p>It is the same kind of thing you enter into,
when you let your body control the car on your way back from work.</p>
<p>Notice, how there is nothing distracting you,
when you enter your trance.</p>
<p>Though there are lots of cars on the road,
they are all average, doing average things.</p>
<hr>
<p>At the gym, a dancer will not upset your focus,
it will encourage you and validate that you are in the right palce.</p>
<p>You will also help other people feel comfortable,
with more dynamic workouts.</p>
<p>A good workout, ultimately,
is the difference between life and death.</p>
<p>It is the people who are showing off, or aren’t working out,
that may upset your focus, in which case, you move to anther corner of the gym.</p>
<hr>
<p>My last piece of gym advice, is for those of you who want instant results,
without removing kitchen appliances, going hiking and camping, or bicycling.</p>
<p>Find a class of stop watch called an in interval timer, you can find apps,
off brand clones, unfortunately there aren’t too many companies that produce them..</p>
<p>Set your interval timer to one minute workout, one minute rest,
clip it on your waist band.</p>
<p>And let the vibrate function tell you when to go and stop,
as your body adapts expand the workout duration, and adjust your rest period.</p>
<p>With the eventual aim, of eliminating your rest entirely,
and working out non stop.</p>
<p>I think accomplishment the same through jogging maybe more pleasant,
as you never have to jog very fast with dumbbells I hands.</p>
<p>But jogging wants good stable weather, well behaved passers by,
preferably crisp and green mornings willed with park trees away from cars.</p>
<p>An interval timer, forces you to do things at the gym,
where like a terrible fat bird, all you get, is a mirror.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lastly, the rule is simple, it is not about how heavy you lift,
it is about how long you lift your heavy for,</p>
<p>You have to start light, not so light that you can lift more,
but never so heavy, that you are forced to stop.</p>
<p>As you body adapts, it gives you a little extra,
so you add a little bit more weight.</p>
<hr>
<p>Get mad, y have been cheated out of bodybuilding by bad advice,
and I think it is time for you to get angry at ineffective education.</p>
<p>Because an ineffective workout, where you call cutting off your circulation,
some kind of mystical muscle failure that will make you buff, is a betrayal.</p>
<p>You need to put an end to the myth of sets and reps,
because it only makes you old and frail.</p>
