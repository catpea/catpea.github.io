            <p>“But we were born of risen apes, not fallen angels, and the apes were armed killers besides.</p>
<p>And so what shall we wonder at? Our murders and massacres and missiles,
and our irreconcilable regiments?</p>
<p>Or our treaties whatever they may be worth;
our symphonies however seldom they may be played;
our peaceful acres, however frequently they may be converted into battlefields;
our dreams however rarely they may be accomplished.</p>
<p>The miracle of man is not how far he has sunk but how magnificently he has risen.</p>
<p>We are known among the stars by our poems, not our corpses.”</p>
<p>-- Robert Ardrey</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>What yo are about to hear, is a complete fabrication, pure conjecture,
it stands here, to prevent you from being scared of the large politics of the world.</p>
<p>It stands here,
asking you to become a Great Being.</p>
<p>By means of self education, authenticity and dignity,
inheritance of wisdom from countless well narrated books describing meaningful lives.</p>
<p>By filling your mind with such genius,
that it will be you, who in greatness, does create a work that will explain the world correctly.</p>
<p>Part One: Criminal Minds</p>
<p>One of the most frightening things are criminals,
who are they, and how can they be so different from us?</p>
<p>They are children, who have been betrayed by adults,
perfectly capable human beings, but raised with a vocabulary of violence.</p>
<p>The way to understand this, is to look at the behavior of un-contacted tribes,
insight into the criminal mind, will be one of their lasting gifts to us.</p>
<hr>
<p>Approaching a warrior of an un-contacted tribe,
is likely to result in bodily injury, or worse.</p>
<p>Their vocabulary, is not a vocabulary of violence, it is far better than that,
a warrior is a powerful, wise and noble creature.</p>
<p>And yet, by out definition, their behavior is criminal,
and the best thing we can do, is not to interact.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, poverty, hunger, homelessness, beatings, shame, drugs, alcohol, hate,
prison, all adds up to create a boy who is like a warrior of an un-contacted tribe.</p>
<p>But here, he has been betrayed by the modern world,
and if his vocabulary wasn’t a vocabulary of violence, he would have long died in the streets.</p>
<p>Both the warrior of an uncontaminated tribe,
and the boy that we have betrayed and abandoned to the streets are deadly.</p>
<p>While the un-contacted tribe, short of some scouts, has made a decision,
not to approach.</p>
<p>In order for the boy of the streets to survive another week,
he will have to approach, to empty a register, to take a purse with an new iphone.</p>
<p>One of his first positions, will be a firearm,
and he will kill, if anyone tries to stop him.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are ways to help him, to prevent him from making enormous mistakes,
but, it will take a life time.</p>
<p>And in the end, this now a man, not just a warrior,
will say, in his greatness, as much as I appreciate your help…</p>
<p>I wish, that instead of spending time with me,
you took the horror of my life, and made the suffering count.</p>
<p>I wish you invested your effort, into preventing other children,
from being betrayed, the way I was betrayed.</p>
<p>Part Two: The Politician</p>
<p>We feel like politics has betrayed us, a politician will vote for their own raise,
but will prevent the lifting of the minimum wage, to something reasonable.</p>
<p>A politician may celebrate, not helping veterans,
and encourage enticing teenagers to go to war.</p>
<p>What is this?
What is going on.</p>
<p>Though they go through an election process, that politicians are elected is largely a fantasy,
they are passed along, in little know elections, and their wealth certainly does not slow them down.</p>
<p>A politician does not represent a quest for goodness,
or a step towards what we want the world to become.</p>
<p>A politician, is more of a man that like a sophisticated life style,
his sport is golf, his suits are expensive, and he likes to buy luxury items.</p>
<p>His family has likely been involved in politics,
and he has been on the ballot for over a decade.</p>
<p>Until he wins, makes new friends, joins new circles,
mingles, smokes cigars, and probably check out the interns.</p>
<p>His understanding of veterans, will be people that shoot machine guns,
and often miss an arm or a leg.</p>
<p>His understanding of your minimum wage,
is not to fcuk with it, or he will not be able to advance up the ladder.</p>
<p>He like cigars, and if he can get away with something,
or get impeached for laying to congress.</p>
<p>It will fcuking make his year,
and he will order a big box of cigars, that will cost more than all the money you spent on college for your kids.</p>
<p>Part Three: The Men Who Sold The World</p>
<p>The teachers, did not in fact conspire to create Deadly Criminals and Stupid Politicians,
They are the kids that students wan to be like, that went into education.</p>
<p>There is an incredible beauty to a teacher,
right up until they realize, they have no clue what to do, and they still fcuking do it to get the paycheck.</p>
<p>You see, the way to prevent the boy from part one,
from becoming a deadly and murderous criminal.</p>
<p>Is helping him to a school that works,
you don’t know what a shool that works is, nobody does.</p>
<p>Because up until now, all the schools in the world, were just an experiment,
and it failed.</p>
<p>It failed with benefits, it created a workforce, a machine for mowing minds,
a machine for posing the future of this world with propaganda.</p>
<p>Like so many other inventions,
the fake opportunistic politicians, allowed the more cunning politicians to get more.</p>
<p>It can be more weapons manufacturing, it can be more interns,
it can be more golf games with the prime minister or president.</p>
<p>More, more more,
more.</p>
<p>The four letter word,
is more.</p>
<p>Schools are a framework that turns a student into a resource,
High-school indoctrinates into college, college takes family savings.</p>
<p>And beyond college, those who do take time to study,
will approach a million dollars in debt.</p>
<p>No singe teacher, sold you out,
no single politician could ever be held responsible.</p>
<hr>
<p>You don’t know math,
because you weren&#39;t taught math.</p>
<p>All that time, you were being coerced into memorization,
to pass the fcuking tests, so that everyone could get paid.</p>
<p>It is not yet know if organized education can be trusted,
but we are beginning to see that standardized education is the greatest betrayal that humanity will even know.</p>
<hr>
<p>Part Four; War</p>
<p>War, is a political card,
it is a privileged of wealthy mad men.</p>
<p>War happens,
because it can happen.</p>
<p>Because it is a card hat can be played,
by sick, detached, blind, and uneducated ghouls.</p>
<p>It is a card that they want to play,
because the death of the young, can restore an old man’s virility.</p>
<p>The teenagers are recruited int military,
out of poverty and education, fo the promise of a car.</p>
<p>Those smarter than that,
just have no choice, they have no choice.</p>
<p>The could, the maybe, the wat if, is not a choice,
there is jus the recruitment office.</p>
<p>The officers, are not better off,
and you certainly don’t want to trust one to get your back.</p>
<p>War will always occur,
at the moment all the shitty politicians nobody voted for corner themselves.</p>
<p>When no one can make a move,
a button is pushed to initialize the war machine.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, let me clarify, this is not about military moves,
the military does not want war, war is the last thing a warrior needs.</p>
<p>The moves,
are political.</p>
<p>Imagine this hypothetical, a nation spends decades providing its people,
with deliberately fake education.</p>
<p>To prevent and neuter any and all potential interference,
with the crime family in change.</p>
<p>Everyone in the more international political community knows this,
the now failed nations propaganda alone is fascinating to watch and get a chuckle out of.</p>
<p>This is not acceptable behavior, because the international community,
must care for all the people in the world, not just the voters in their nations.</p>
<p>The nation that disabled the minds of its people,
with fear, mostly, poor people are not stupid…</p>
<p>They saw it coming,
and they saw us looking away, from all the harm that was being done to them.</p>
<p>This kind of a nation will suffer the worst economic disasters,
not just from freak events like pandemics…</p>
<p>Just the chaos of the criminal misery that they created,
is enough to cause an economic failure.</p>
<p>And that, is the stale mate, and it is born of incompetence,
and that is where war begins.</p>
<p>What seems to us as madness,
is to a warped government, a way to reboot the economy.</p>
<hr>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Every move you make in life, magnified by all the other motions,
has consequence, the butterfly effect is real.</p>
<p>By blindly accepting high school for what it is,
just doing your homework, and following your stupid friends.</p>
<p>You don’t create a war, but you feed the random noise,
from which it can emerge.</p>
<p>To borrow from Gibson,
you become a gray dot on a TV screen tuned to a dead channel.</p>
<p>By doing nothing, you empower those,
who do evil by taking advantage of indifference.</p>
<p>Rise,
rise.</p>
<p>Not to project mayhem,
which only reveal stupidity and laziness.</p>
<p>But to Project Humanity,
and World Peace.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is a simple task,
use World Poverty to erase it self.</p>
<p>Create a school, that functions like a computer game,
you can’t pass a level, until you are really good at it.</p>
<p>Find large corporations willing to bet against the Nuclear War,
that will put them out of business.</p>
<p>And put an initial fund together, to pay your students,
pay them well for learning for real.</p>
<p>Learning programming or design are good examples,
of the learning for real patterns of self driven education.</p>
<p>Let your first class graduate, find their own investors,
and take 10% of their profits, to continue fueling your school.</p>
<p>You can view the school as a colorful and powerful startup accelerator,
but it is not there to turn a profit.</p>
<p>This is the school,
the school that we all thought we were going to when we were little.</p>
<p>You and the countless many others that accept this challenge,
will create the first real and effective schools around the world.</p>
<p>Not for profit, not for glory,
but for lifting Humanity’s level of education, helping it activate its genius.</p>
<p>For  helping all the world cultures grow up,
and finally converge in Wisdom and Greatness on World Peace.</p>
