            <p>Above all,
you still need a real education.</p>
<p>Without a meaningful and effective education,
you are not just going to be used, but abused.</p>
<p>Life and Work will stress you out,
that you will be force to overeat or worse, just t get through another day.</p>
<hr>
<p>Real education, is self directed, self paced,
it only touches upon your own curiosities in a perfect sequence.</p>
<p>And the first few years, is just about hiking and camping,
and listening to thousands of powerful narrated books.</p>
<p>This is the modern version,
of the ancient quest for knowledge and storytelling by the fire.</p>
<p>You need those books to catch up,
to the highest of heights humanity&#39;s greatest thinkers rose to.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you fail to internalize and comprehend you intellectual inheritance,
you will be indoctrinated into a subset of reality.</p>
<p>Often, the culture you are being indoctrinated into is emergent,
it simply self assembles out of fake education, poverty, violence, depression and drug use.</p>
<p>The true human culture, is deeply intellectual,
it is the result of knowledge combining to create wisdom, and the resulting call to greatness.</p>
<p>Greatness, is just growing all the way up,
I don’t have to explain to you how important that is.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now let me show you, what you are up against,
and please understand no one designed this system.</p>
<p>It is the result of fakers pretending until they make it,
liars getting a kick from getting away with everything, and stupidity mixed with greed.</p>
<p>Teachers just want to get paid,
they need to put food on their table, and teaching is all they got.</p>
<p>They will not let you stand in their way of that paycheck,
they will trick you, cripple curricula, and ultimately sell your mind out.</p>
<p>All the while pretending to be overworked, holier than though,
and that they give a damn, about you, or education, or anything else.</p>
<p>They are not evil, but they bargain with it, they know schools don’t work,
but instead of calling for repairs, they compromise, to make them appear to work.</p>
<p>And; as that saying goes, in a compromise between good an evil,
only evil can profit. (Rand)</p>
<hr>
<p>Some teachers do hate you,
because you make their days unnecessarily difficult.</p>
<p>You make them work,
in an ineffective system of education, where that does not matter.</p>
<p>And they do call you names behind you back,
Hormones, appears to be popular.</p>
<hr>
<p>The threat of being held back is pure evil,
this is not something anyone should eve tolerate.</p>
<p>It is a massive threat that corrupts everything,
it will make students tolerate fake education, and never look back.</p>
<hr>
<p>The grades are fake, officially to combat what they call grade inflation,
but in reality they’ve been used to manipulate you and forge teacher performance.</p>
<p>There is nothing that can be graded in an ineffective educational system,
and even if there was, no rational person would mark a person with a number.</p>
<hr>
<p>The teachers are aware that you use the GPA to define yourself,
that you see it as you level of intelligence.</p>
<p>But the grades are fake, 1/3 A, 1/3, B, 1/3 C,
if you eve had your GPA suddenly take a dive.</p>
<p>That was just the school diving bleow th radar,
beceuse it’s collective GPA was too high, and would create questions.</p>
<p>And if not that, then teachers simply copy grades from your other classes,
They estimate what you are in math based on Chemistry and Physics.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your GPA is a threat in disguise,
it is used to silence you.</p>
<p>Force you into cramming and memorization,
under the threat of you ruining your future.</p>
<hr>
<p>Confusion, confusing tests, books, lectures, materials,
all add up to forcing you to stop thinking and begin memorizing.</p>
<p>Cramming and memorization,
is not your invention.</p>
<p>You’ve been forced into it, is their neatest trick,
because it is a reliable and predictable way, for them to look like they are teaching.</p>
<p>For the duration of a test, temporary memorization,
is largely indistinguishable from actual integrated knowledge.</p>
<p>This way they don’t actually have to teach anything,
or make any sense at all.</p>
<hr>
<p>The difficult teats that give you a feeling of accomplishment,
and yet keep in you doubt, thinking that you could do better.</p>
<p>Are another trick, they make you feel like there is hard earned content,
but in the end, it never comes together.</p>
<p>It is noise, that does not integrate,
into your existing body of knowledge.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can only learn and integrate new knowledge in your own sequence,
and at your own pace, while you feel safety and serenity.</p>
<p>Being put into a concrete rat cage of classroom and rows,
all neatly divided into time periods that tear whatever remains of your private curiosities to sheds….</p>
<p>Is not education, it is an attack on your mind, it is how delicate students fracture,
it is the reason why kids in high school do drugs.</p>
<p>They are beaten at home, betrayed at school,
and punished for the bad grades.</p>
<p>Teachers know that schools push students into drug use,
schools tolerate it because it keeps the GPA high.</p>
<hr>
<p>They want silence,
and obedience.</p>
<p>So that everyone who is involved in working for the the school,
gets paid.</p>
<p>From the lawnmower men, to creepy security guards,
teachers, principals, and whatever parasites sit above.</p>
<hr>
<p>Teachers do not care that High School,
will push you into a paid school.</p>
<p>They don’t care that student loans are unforgivable by bankruptcy,
and will be forcefully removed from your paycheck.</p>
<p>That some are still paying them off,
well into their 60/s.</p>
<hr>
<p>As you can imagine, graduation is meaningless,
the diploma has little value.</p>
<p>However, former students,
are taught that people without a High School diploma are inferior.</p>
<p>Any potential employer with throw away your application,
they don’t know what education is, and that their education is fake.</p>
<p>They were just spoonfed,
no diploma is bad employee.</p>
<p>The career ahead of you,
will be studded with liars and pretenders.</p>
<p>And if you ask for too much,
you will be replaced by two cheaper employees.</p>
<hr>
<p>When your parents will try to explain to you,
that all of this is just a conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>Ask them, if chemistry class taught them chemistry,
or physics class, taught hem physics.</p>
<p>Ask them is they feel proud or embarrassed,
that all they remember is shreds of useless formulas.</p>
<p>Ask them to recite, that “mitochondria is a powerhouse of the cell”,
and keep a straight face.</p>
<hr>
<p>You are going to be cheated out of education,
therefore, begin your self education as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Begin learning programming, just a little bit,
to see the difference between learning something useful and something that is noise.</p>
<p>And get your mittens on all of the world’s most powerful narrated books,
all the ones loved by clear thinkers, intellectual, and great beings.</p>
<p>Take to adventure, prepare to section hike,
the Appalachian, Pacific Crest, and Continental divide trails.</p>
<p>The trails will make room in your mind,
so that you can comprehend all the books that you read and re-read.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, computers are the future, learn enough about programming,
so that you can manage a team of developers.</p>
<p>Aim to improve an existing service, get investors if necessary,
and become an independent entrepreneur.</p>
