            <p>Unlike fake education, that cannot help but to drift towards more abstraction,
and thus become ever more ineffective.</p>
<p>Real things are always intricately stitched together,
they don&#39;t just influence one another, but provide critical support to each other.</p>
<p>In this text you will learn, that it is not possible for you to have a fit body,
without also having a fit mind.</p>
<p>Nor will ti be possible for you to merely exists in some state of fitness,
but you will face great challenges, that will test both your greatness and legacy.</p>
<hr>
<p>By now you have figured out that you job is killing you,
and not a single creature is stirring.</p>
<p>It all begun in school, the subjects when combined together,
do not actually constitute an education.</p>
<p>They constitute a way to make money off of unsuspecting people,
as a result, you will learn nothing, and life will be a constant uphill battle.</p>
<p>No real education,
means constant desperation.</p>
<hr>
<p>Very few people do well after graduation,
while not everyone becomes large…</p>
<p>It is rare creature in deed,
that does not get messed up by something.</p>
<p>And this is where fitness begins,
not with jogging, or walking, but getting a real f@cking education.</p>
<p>You can’t finish your recovery, or heal your wounds,
without your intellectual inheritance.</p>
<p>All the works of all the clear thinking great beings,
whispered into your ears, by means of narrated books.</p>
<hr>
<p>Oh yes, you won’t understand a damn thing in the state of mind,
that you are in now… but fixing that is easy.</p>
<p>Depending on your size large, medium or healthy,
you will need to walk one, two or three of the great American trails.</p>
<p>If you are healthy, take the Appalachian Trail,
and listen to your books carefully.</p>
<p>If you are medium sized, so will be your adventure,
you will need to train to walk 20 miles a day at home.</p>
<p>And then walk the Appalachian and Pacific Crest Trails,
it is a beautiful challenge, supremely enabling for healthy people as well.</p>
<p>And if you are large, you will train and begin section hiking,
all three trails, including the Continental Divide.</p>
<p>Take it easy, love yourself, hike the most beautiful parts first,
your body will heal at its own rate…</p>
<p>And it will absolutely demand,
serenity, beauty, and wisest of books.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overachieving, Overwork ,and Overeating,
will rob you of OVER 30 years of your life.</p>
<p>If you haven’t noticed it yet,
there are no obese elderly.</p>
<p>And there are no health professionals, or real teachers,
that will disagree with the following statement:</p>
<p>“Your feet, are made for walking,
and your ears are made for hearing.”</p>
<p>This is a loving, forgiving, and beautiful,
first step to your recovery, from diving head first into an unexamined life.</p>
<p>No one is wise enough to tell you what must come second,
as you know your body best, you will know your limits best.</p>
<p>And only you can select the best workout sequence for yourself,
you don’t need a trainer, you just need to inherit wisdom from books.</p>
<p>We can make some guesses,
ahead of time, though.</p>
<p>If you are large, I have awesome news for you,
even better if you suffered childhood obesity or neglect.</p>
<p>Under all that fat, is a bodybuilder - don’t laugh,
whether you are a woman or a man – you are ridiculously muscular.</p>
<p>Be sure to consume protein on the trail,
in hopes of preserving those muscles.</p>
<p>You may wish to consider putting on a weight vest,
at some point – once you lose the unhealthiest of your weight.</p>
<p>And you must protect the hard earned endurance,
that you gain when walking the trails.</p>
<p>You will need more than jogging,
you will need to jog or dance with dumbbells.</p>
<p>The next big challenge after using up your fat reserves,
and protecting muscles, is getting flexible.</p>
<p>Dancing with dumbbells, maybe water resistance training,
and certainly continuing to hike is in your cards.</p>
<hr>
<p>Which brings us to the latter part of your life,
this is the part that is after your original death.</p>
<p>The part that you created for yourself,
the part, where you serve no one.</p>
<hr>
<p>You didn’t just fall a victim to an indoctrination into a crappy lifestyle,
that treated you as a resource to be mined.</p>
<p>There is actually no mastermind, no conspiracy, to project mayhem,
it is just the raw uneducated human nature that is leading us to a nuclear war.</p>
<p>And you maybe able to guess already, there will be no mastermind,
no master plan, just natural confabulation of uneducated liars.</p>
<p>That will lead the false leaders right at the beginning of war to say little more than:
“We launched the nuclear missiles, because that is what you do with them”.</p>
<p>And then at the end of war, utter, whist weeping at the result of their actions,
“How were we supposed to know?”</p>
<p>As I write this text the nuclear testing has stepped up today,
and you are nowhere ready to accept the responsibility for preventing that war.</p>
<p>See, there is no such thing as fitness of body,
without fitness of mind…</p>
<p>Either you rise to become a great being,
or die a resource stripped to maximum.</p>
<p>War as you can imagine, is fueled nor by weapons,
but by young people.</p>
<p>If this is the big one, and you can’t stop it,
then tens of millions of young people will perish in battle.</p>
<p>And countless many,
in by that time, what once were the largest cities.</p>
<hr>
<p>War is not prevented by getting yourself arrested during the protests,
those people are sent into the battle close second.</p>
<p>The early successes of a war,
destroy those who gave their lives against it.</p>
<p>War is prevented, by repairing schools,
the first thing that was made for you, and turned against you, to turn a profit.</p>
<hr>
<p>The way you studied your books of the initial trails,
when you were young, when you first begun.</p>
<p>Is the only safe way,
that students can actually learn.</p>
<p>They have to be on the train, in the context,
to develop a need for what is in the great books.</p>
<p>No one who will hear what the clear thinking great beings have to say,
will allow humanity to drift towards war.</p>
<p>After you pass, a new century will begin,
it will be as different a 1900s were from 2000s.</p>
<p>But 2100 hundreds will be as desperate to arrest repetition of mistakes,
as we should be today, given that major superpowers are rebooting their test programs.</p>
<hr>
<p>You have been failed by teachers,
into repeating mistakes as, the aimlessly drifting humanity hopes to strip-mine you for whatever there is.</p>
<p>Donations, overpriced textbooks, college loans, university loans,
or even tolerance of toxic materials, forever chemicals in your food, whatever you got.</p>
<p>And the driving force is little more than confabulation,
of false leaders who aim to protect their positions of power.</p>
<p>To us mandatory draft into a nuclear war,
is horror, as we watch the younger generation fade.</p>
<p>To a false leader, it is yet another fine piece of evidence;
that they are an authentic wartime president – <em><strong>to them it is good luck.</strong></em></p>
<hr>
<p>It is not possible for you to just repair your body,
you must also repair your mind, and grow all the way up, until you become a great being.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is no more time, for you to go to work,
ordinary days are over, there are none left for you.</p>
<p>In the absence of teachers,
you have to learn to teach.</p>
<p>You can’t just grant yourself another 30 to 50 years,
just to watch humanity meander towards predictable ends.</p>
<p>You can’t just change yourself,
you have to change the world.</p>
