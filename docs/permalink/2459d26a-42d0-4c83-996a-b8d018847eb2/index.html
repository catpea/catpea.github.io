            <p>When you are young, it is profoundly important,
to learn about Artists, Adventurers, Philosophers, and Great Beings.</p>
<p>But also to understand that appearances are misleading,
and that growing up requires constant learning and effort.</p>
<p>Just because someone looks like an adult,
does not mean that they are an adult yet.</p>
<hr>
<p>As we grow, we move past labels,
and value results, over anything else.</p>
<p>I used to call it the sum of all intent across a person’s history,
but I think perhaps, the word results captures it better.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is not about drawing divisions, or belittling adults,
this is about reminding ourselves…</p>
<p>That we must continue learning and creating,
being an adult is not about being older, it is about being wiser.</p>
<p>It is also about safety, we have to eplain to young people,
that just because someone looks wise, it does not mean that they are.</p>
<p>We must teach to judge adults by content of character,
by wisdom, and by how they rose from their mistakes.</p>
<p>This is very important in politics,
image is not enough.</p>
<hr>
<p>Overwork and stress,
ended in me driving to a distant hospital with blood-clots in my lung.</p>
<p>This is what I mean by the word result,
I got what I deserved.</p>
<hr>
<p>As I begun my second life,
I once noticed paramedics by a nearby highway.</p>
<p>It was an old car, he had time to pull aside,
to protect others.</p>
<p>The paramedics look at me on my bicycle,
and we understood the right from wrong.</p>
<p>Work does not set you free,
and overwork kills you.</p>
<p>Not in an abstract way,
but right on the side of the highway.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is why we must young people understand,
that Artist, Adventurer, Philosopher, and Great Being are not just labels.</p>
<p>But stages in life,
that will keep their minds healthy and safe.</p>
<p>A universe without those words, or words like it,
would be a terrible place.</p>
<p>It makes for a fine attack on a civilization, to trick children into believing,
they are not good enough to become any of those.</p>
<p>Or that philosophy is unnecessary,
or even funny.</p>
<hr>
<p>But as you can clearly imagine,
an artists without results, without works of art to display is in BIG TROUBLE.</p>
<p>It means a young person is stuck, and hurt, and unable to think,
and without achieving, or thinking they can grow.</p>
<p>An adult without results, is not a fraud,
but they are unwell.</p>
<hr>
<p>Allow me to speak of my Bodybuilding Technique,
and Programming, to show you what an adult should show.</p>
<p>In my programming, as in life, I begun following the main trend,
and ended up being able to work for a company.</p>
<p>But when it came to making Desktop Applications that I could sell,
Languages like Perl, ASP and PHP, SQL Databases, Web Pages were not good.</p>
<p>Even ActionScript which I enjoyed and Java which is neat but useless,
didn’t hep me much.</p>
<p>Moreover, being a single developer,
I had to abandon the idea of multiple languages and closed platforms.</p>
<p>I needed libraries I could reuse without modification,
on the server, in the browser and its add-ons and even database.</p>
<p>I moved towards node.js for server work, and electron.js for Desktop,
which actually includes node js.</p>
<p>I rewired my brain for JavaScript, of which I think of as ECMAScript,
and privately I see it as my dreams of Perl, the language that was most beautiful to me.</p>
<hr>
<p>The result is that AI makes apps for me that run live in the chat,
that I completely understand, and can do better.</p>
<p>I have an XML parser which combined with a solid and tested grasp,
on tagged template literals will give me a simple language that uses signals.</p>
<p>It has been done before, but not so simply,
that AI does not need instructions to understand it.</p>
<p>This language, gives me the ability to use SVG graphics,
with components that automatically update when data changes.</p>
<p>The result is easy to generate AI applications, with minimal code,
that I can put into Firefox Addons especially devtools and make programming simpler.</p>
<p>A developer tool, is not an app, it is oxygen, it is critical and vital,
and actually worth paying for.</p>
<p>Developer tools for hardcore programmers,
and especially the new to programming is where I will build my business.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is not something a child can do, because it takes 20 years,
to explore, understand, and most importantly for me, master.</p>
<p>So it is a thing of adulthood, an investment of years,
and now with AI, I am speechless.</p>
<p>All my tangents closed, all my curiosities satisfied,
all the side quests complete.</p>
<p>Don’t start your software empire hoping to win,
win first, and then go into battle.</p>
<hr>
<p>And now for my bodybuilding, an extension for finally conquering obesity,
and becoming healthy, not just fit, but guaranteed to stay that way this time.</p>
<p>I started by seeking evidence of muscle growth,
so I begun looking at the results I knew I could trust.</p>
<p>And slowly jogging while heavy revealed my calves,
as a source of understanding bodybuilding.</p>
<p>So it is a weight you <em>can</em> carry for extended durations,
with as little stopping as possible.</p>
<p>I also approached bodybuilding with a childlike misunderstanding,
because when I was a baby I just assumed Conan’s Wheel of Pain is how it is done.</p>
<p>That only pushed me towards duration,
expanding my workouts to one and then two hours for seven days.</p>
<p>I now do three hours for 5 days,
it just seems like it is good to have two days to heal.</p>
<hr>
<p>But as everyone else, I initially grew muscles,
and I stopped growing,</p>
<p>My body handled the challenge of a crappy workout,
and stopped adapting.</p>
<p>It was not possible for me to lift heavier weights,
so I went to the beginning of the rack.</p>
<p>To try to lift non-stop for an hour,
people thought that was strange.</p>
<p>I needed the dumbbells by my side,
but I was not able to pick them off the ground.</p>
<p>So I took one of the stupid benches that force everyone to sit,
rotated it sideways, and I put my dumbbells on it.</p>
<p>Now I was able to put the dumbbells down for a moment,
and quickly pick them up, ad continue pushing to lift more frequently.</p>
<p>Being able to pick the dumbbells up,
and put them down put me in the zone.</p>
<p>Apparently bodybuilder refer to the zone as flow,
today I just call it focus.</p>
<p>And I try to avoid people that stare at me inappropriately,
people who wear perfume, loud speakers overhead with gym music.</p>
<p>And I push myself further into the flow and focus,
by moving to the beats of songs, which induces a dance trance.</p>
<p>I get so comfortable, that my three hour workouts,
feel like 15 minutes, and I do a solid 10 minutes of programming in my imagination.</p>
<p>I just close my eyes, visualize my programs,
make something really nice, and it is time to go, three hours are up.</p>
<hr>
<p>As you can imagine putting your body under three hours,
of progressively heavier weights, 5 days a week, builds the muscle.</p>
<p>Burn the fat, grants frightening flexibly,
and without injury, because I am still in the 15lb per hand zone.</p>
<hr>
<p>I try lots of little experiments,
I change music genre to control movement speed.</p>
<p>I try slow and heavy, which is questionable,
find 20 lb per hand non-stop for three hours, dangerous.</p>
<p>Though 17.5 seems alright,
which would indicate, I have not yet adapted to a higher weight.</p>
<p>I tried trail mix, discovering peanuts and dried fruit,
as a source of incredible power.</p>
<p>I use an energy electrolyte drink mix with a cola amount of caffeine,
but I avoid citric acid, so I flavor my drink with root beer.</p>
<p>Without the electrolyte drink mix, I get back pain,
and I keep on the low, as not to have too much of it in my sytem.</p>
<p>Because, salt does seems suspicious,
but you need some of it.</p>
<hr>
<p>Each time I add something,
I try to see if there are results.</p>
<p>I slowed down my music once too much,
and I seemed to have stopped making fast progress.</p>
<p>Returning to dance music and lighter dumbbells,
not only gave me larger muscles but also diminished my sides.</p>
<p>I am becoming movie star shaped,
but I also care about flexibility.</p>
<p>It has been years since I needed to put my dumbbells on a bench,
but I still want flexibility.</p>
<p>And for that I dance, flex, turn,
my flexibility is realistically improving daily.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am not a large bodybuilder, I am aware that muscles atrophy,
and I consider muscle isolation exercises a waste of time.</p>
<p>My dancing however, is about building a life long workout routine,
that I can perform anywhere.</p>
<p>I can totally imagine people tossing a coin into my cowboy hat,
during a workout in my 80s, I can do dancing with dumbbells well.</p>
<p>My total bodybuilding result,
is the result of me seeking little results along the way.</p>
<p>I always check if what I am doing,
is producing results.</p>
<hr>
<p>Compare that to sets and reps, which are like a label,
you show up for the gym, do sets and pres and go.</p>
<p>That grows muscle only once, when you go from sedentary lifestyle,
to doing something, even when it is done incorrectly.</p>
<p>It is very sad for me to see that people go through the effort of going to the gym,
but expect different results from doing the same thing.</p>
<p>I came up with a short little instruction set,
but, even so the few people that I mentioned it to did not care.</p>
<p>“Lift light, but not so light that you can lift more,
and never so heavy that you are forced to stop”.</p>
<p>I tell some people looking for a backbone or quick results,
about interval times.</p>
<p>Noting that the aim of an interval timer,
is to eliminate the rest period, just like joggers do it.</p>
<hr>
<p>In closing, you can see that labels only point the way,
and it is the results that matter.</p>
<p>Bodybuilding and programming,
shows results that can’t be made up.</p>
<p>Also, both programmers and bodybuilders would be able to quickly tell,
how a person go to their results.</p>
<p>But ultimately the person who does the pretending,
is the fool.</p>
<p>Shortcuts in bodybuilding kill,
shortcuts in programming lead absolutely nowhere, it is a very delicate art.</p>
<hr>
<p>Use labels to navigate, to measure how far you will travel,
how wonderful and fantastic your arrival is going to be.</p>
<p>But stand in the area, learn,
wisely evaluating the results of every effort you make.</p>
