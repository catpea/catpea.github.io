            <p>People are tricked into thinking that music theory is required for making music,</p>
<p>and schools deliver music theory as a single indivisible blob.</p>
<p>With modern schools focusing on standardized testing,</p>
<p>schools trick kids into thinking that memorization is a kind of learning.</p>
<p>But memorization is only about keeping the grade point average high enough,</p>
<p>for everyone who works for that school to get paid.</p>
<p>From the teacher&#39;s perspective,</p>
<p>they are doing their job, so that they can get paid.</p>
<p>From the student&#39;s perspective,</p>
<p>they are trying to get good grades to get into good college, and get a good job.</p>
<p>But, we have to stop and ask,</p>
<p>is the school teaching, are the children learning?</p>
<hr>
<p>Children can&#39;t tell the schools are bad for them,</p>
<p>because they do not know enough about life, and they tend to follow directions.</p>
<p>Adults have the same problem with politics,</p>
<p>politicians are actors that act just enough to get what they personally want.</p>
<p>It only takes a few liars to disable a nation,</p>
<p>but what we are seeing, is that here are only few honest people there.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the politician, they serve their people,</p>
<p>and it is their job to inspire their trust.</p>
<p>From a psychologists perspective,</p>
<p>that is lying.</p>
<p>I wonder where all the psychologists are,</p>
<p>with each passing decade their rise to their spotlight becomes more and more critical.</p>
<hr>
<p>Most of us hear &quot;C Major&quot;, or &quot;C Minor&quot;,</p>
<p>that is just code for saying that we will start with the note C, and then focus on a pattern of notes named Major.</p>
<p>A scale is,</p>
<p>a pallet of 8 colors that the musician has chosen to compose with.</p>
<p>In painting colors are super important,</p>
<p>you really want to get the right yellow and orange to paint a sunrise, you have to mix them just right.</p>
<p>And just imagine the importance of colors when it comes to painting a portrait,</p>
<p>a starting artist may wish for a pre-mixed set of colors for just painting portrait - it sounds as useful as it is.</p>
<p>That is what a scale is,</p>
<p>a selection of pre-mixed notes so that a person can focus on making melodies.</p>
<p>That is the very least we need to take away from music class,</p>
<p>that is all it takes to give us the ability to express ourselves with music.</p>
<hr>
<p>If children are forced to take tests, that obscure this gift of self-expression,</p>
<p>its simplicity, glory, reward, empowerment, then they are being cheated.</p>
<p>If someone was to sit you down at a piano,</p>
<p>that had a knob that would let you choose from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_musical_scales_and_modes">all the scales</a> and highlight the keys of a selected scale.</p>
<p>You would immediately find a selection of notes that would match your feelings,</p>
<p>and begin composing.</p>
<p>Listen, this is true, you only get eight keys,</p>
<p>you can only go up and down, and at a pace that fits your feeling, there is nothing difficult about this.</p>
<p>More than that, you would be playing the soul of the song,</p>
<p>with sounds that connect with your feelings.</p>
<p>And then you would be called to add another layer,</p>
<p>a melody to bring light and wisdom to that world.</p>
<hr>
<p>And again, if we continue tolerating politicians that split their heads in two,</p>
<p>one being I must act to appear amazing, and two being I must take care of my own business first - the world will not grow.</p>
<p>World&#39;s politicians bifurcating is probably to a considerable degree,</p>
<p>influenced by the in-authenticity they are forced to participate in schools.</p>
<p>We are scaring the children that if they don&#39;t memorize,</p>
<p>they will be held back and called stupid.</p>
<p>We are preventing children from learning,</p>
<p>by sending them to memorization and meat processing plants.</p>
<p>Humanity will not progress,</p>
<p>if this continues.</p>
<hr>
<p>The saddest thing of all is that children think they are learning</p>
<p>by passing all the tests, they call it learning, they know it as learning.</p>
<p>If memorization is ever taken away from them,</p>
<p>they will protest that education is being stolen.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some kids do figure out they can&#39;t be creative,</p>
<p>and must instead perform this ritual of memorization - I think most of them still think of the ritual as learning.</p>
<p>When other kids hear of this ritual sacrifice, they see it as madness,</p>
<p>in their minds it sounds like you can&#39;t be creative after you get good grades from music class.</p>
<p>Children are trying to figure this out,</p>
<p>but they can&#39;t, they don&#39;t have enough experience.</p>
<hr>
<p>To the person who senses that they must sacrifice their unique creativity to get good grades,</p>
<p>we must say, &quot;If you do that, then our world will die.&quot;.</p>
<p>What makes a person unique and creative, must be protected and developed,</p>
<p>destroying that, with stress, threats of being held back, creates the surface for liars to thrive in.</p>
<p>A liar is after all, is a perfectly uneducated and hollow individual,</p>
<p>skilled in in getting everything, anyway.</p>
<hr>
<p>To the person who says that learning music or science in school,</p>
<p>gives us the ability to be creative.</p>
<p>We have to say, no,</p>
<p>we have to end this illusion.</p>
<p>The illusion of education by means of memorization and mediocrity, and cramming, and pretending,</p>
<p>because, again, that only creates a surface for big fat white lice to feed on the future of this world.</p>
<p>We have to to explain to this obviously intelligent individual,</p>
<p>that school is only holding him back.</p>
<p>It will come as shock at first, but that is not such a bad thing,</p>
<p>because this shock will awaken a healthy skepticism that they are likely to employ in all their decision making.</p>
<p>Kids are are protecting a system of education,</p>
<p>that did nothing for us.</p>
<p>Everything up to high school is working out nicely,</p>
<p>it is when the subject divisions and tests that force memorization are introduced that education ends, and pretending begins.</p>
<p>Children don&#39;t pretend because they want to be actors,</p>
<p>but because it is impossible to graduate with a good GPA and still learn for real.</p>
<hr>
<p>A teacher would make a fair point here and state that they have to rely on a separate entity to build the curriculum,</p>
<p>it does make sense that a teacher should receive help with structuring their lectures and semesters.</p>
<p>While they already know much of what they will teach,</p>
<p>they still need structure.</p>
<p>But, like with that intelligent student that we have to say no to,</p>
<p>we must say no to the teachers as well.</p>
<p>No one but the student is allowed to structure the material,</p>
<p>it must be structured in a way that keeps them going, keeps them interested and passionate about their next steps.</p>
<p>The new curriculum should be based on a body of knowledge created by all the worlds students,</p>
<p>but the path must honor their uniqueness and existing creativity, must match their existing knowledge, and pace of learning.</p>
<hr>
<p>Both politics and education can be greatly improved with interactive visualizations and info-graphics,</p>
<p>just like a student should know where their path will take them, a voter should be able to see and comprehend the results of their vote.</p>
<p>Students should not be graded, they are still learning life,</p>
<p>and in the new schools they will be learning the correct things at the correct pace.</p>
<p>But politicians, do need grades once they begin serving,</p>
<p>furthermore the voters should base a lot of their decisions on the unique history of the politician&#39;s education.</p>
<p>A decades long open and ongoing history of curiosities and achievements built by a political candidate in the new school,</p>
<p>will prevent liars from entering positions that are meant for the true leaders of future generations.</p>
<hr>
<p>A musical scale is just a selection of a few colors that the musician pre-selected, to paint their feelings with,</p>
<p>in a song they sat down to compose.</p>
<p>A real school,</p>
<p>would make you a musician in the course of a day.</p>
<p>We are meant to learn for real, knowledge that results in wisdom,</p>
<p>and wisdom, that if we choose, will take us to greatness.</p>
<p>Let us take no sides when it comes to Future of Humanity,</p>
<p>we are but temporary keepers of this world as it belongs to all the future generations - there is no place for in-authenticity here.</p>
<p>Let us say no, to make believe education,</p>
<p>and let us say no to uneducated actors in roles of self serving leadership.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let us honor all the future generations,</p>
<p>by creating real schools that provide meaningful and personalized education.</p>
