            <p>In the gray parade of days identical,
where desire feeds on desire&#39;s empty bowl,
where we are puppets to a blind Will&#39;s pull—
slaves to comfort, to the predictable—</p>
<p>But wait. If Will is all, then Will can turn
against its own dull repetition&#39;s curse.
The very force that makes us slaves can burn
through mediocrity&#39;s rehearsed verse.</p>
<p>Rise, then! Not to escape the Will, but be
its conscious lightning, its awakened form.
Transform the hunger into artistry,
make suffering birth the extraordinary storm.</p>
<p>The masses sleep in Will&#39;s unconscious dream—
but you can wake, and make the darkness gleam.</p>
<hr>
<p>They say, they think, they do—the faceless &quot;they&quot;—
and so we follow, lost in idle talk,
absorbed in screens, in comfort&#39;s soft decay,
mere shadows who have forgotten how to walk.</p>
<p>This average everydayness kills the soul,
this falling into what &quot;one does&quot; and &quot;should.&quot;
We flee from death by playing the safe role,
mistaking the inauthentic for the good.</p>
<p>But Dasein calls! Your being-toward-death waits
to shatter all pretense of the secure.
Anxiety breaks open Being&#39;s gates—
only in facing void can you be sure</p>
<p>that you exist. Choose yourself against the crowd.
Stand naked in your truth. Live death aloud.</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;I am what I am&quot;—the coward&#39;s plea,
hiding behind false essence like a wall.
&quot;Just human nature,&quot; &quot;That&#39;s just me,&quot;
excuses that make slaves of us all.</p>
<p>Condemned to freedom, yet we choose our chains,
prefer the comfort of the pre-defined.
We act our roles while existence wanes,
bad faith the poison of the modern mind.</p>
<p>But you are nothing till you make yourself!
No essence waits—existence leads the way.
Cast off the masks upon the social shelf,
create your meaning fresh with every day.</p>
<p>The anguish of pure freedom is the price
of being more than society&#39;s device.</p>
<hr>
<p>The herd seeks only pleasure, flees from pain,
represses every drive that might disturb
their careful equilibrium&#39;s refrain,
sublimating greatness to the suburb.</p>
<p>They live in compromise, in half-desires,
their super-ego keeping id in check,
never knowing their unconscious fires,
shipwrecked souls upon normality&#39;s deck.</p>
<p>But dare to know your depths! Let id speak loud,
not in mere hedonism&#39;s shallow pool,
but channeled into works that shake the crowd—
sublimation as a transformative tool.</p>
<p>The ones who dare to face their darkest night
transform neurosis into blazing light.</p>
<hr>
<p>They serve their spooks—the State, the God, the Cause,
believing these abstractions are more real
than their own breathing. Society&#39;s laws
become the only truths that they can feel.</p>
<p>The masses are possessed by their own thoughts,
enslaved to concepts they themselves create,
their uniqueness sold for common oughts,
their fire dimmed to democratic slate.</p>
<p>But you are not a &quot;human,&quot; not a &quot;man&quot;—
you are The Unique, incomparable one!
Let fixed ideas crumble where they can,
own yourself beneath no abstract sun.</p>
<p>The creative nothing that you are can rise
beyond all spooks, all socially-sanctioned lies.</p>
<hr>
<p>Clock-time ticks on, mechanical and dead,
while humans live by schedules, not by soul,
measuring life in units that have fled,
missing duration&#39;s ever-flowing whole.</p>
<p>They spatialize their existence, make it thing,
divide their days in quantities to hoard,
never knowing time&#39;s creative spring,
the élan vital they&#39;ve ignored.</p>
<p>But real time flows! It&#39;s quality, not sum,
each moment pregnant with the wholly new.
Don&#39;t count your days—let intuition come
and show what intellect can never view.</p>
<p>In duration&#39;s dance, the mediocre breaks—
creative evolution when one wakes.</p>
<hr>
<p>The masses seek false meaning, crave the lie
that universe cares about their fate.
They&#39;d rather sleep than hear the silent sky,
choose comfortable myths to contemplate.</p>
<p>But you—you know the absurd truth full well:
no meaning waits, no purpose pre-exists.
Yet unlike those who in resentment dwell,
you&#39;ll clench your freedom in defiant fists.</p>
<p>Sisyphus smiles as he climbs again—
not resigned but choosing his revolt.
Create in spite of meaninglessness&#39;s reign,
let joy be your existential jolt.</p>
<p>The mediocre flee from the absurd—
but you make meaning with your every word.</p>
<hr>
<p>The sedentary souls stay in their place,
their thoughts run only in established grooves,
accepting limits, never changing pace,
while life itself perpetually moves.</p>
<p>They think in beings, never in becomings,
trapped in representation&#39;s rigid frame,
their desires channeled into state-planned plumbing,
their difference always reduced to same.</p>
<p>But be nomadic! Let your thinking roam
across smooth space where concepts can&#39;t contain.
Deterritorialize what seems like home,
let multiplicities rewire your brain.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t be a state individual—be a flow,
assemblages in constant overthrow.</p>
<hr>
<p>&quot;Whatever is, is right&quot;—the masses say,
bowing to custom&#39;s suffocating weight.
Eccentricity they fear and push away,
conformity becomes their chosen fate.</p>
<p>The despotism of custom kills the new,
makes humans into copies of the past.
Social tyranny tells you what to do
until your very selfhood cannot last.</p>
<p>But liberty demands experiments!
In living as in thinking, dare to stray.
Your eccentricity makes precedents
for futures that the timid can&#39;t convey.</p>
<p>The harm you do to none—so live your truth,
and let your strangeness renovate the youth.</p>
<hr>
<p>The masses drift, they do not truly act,
mere pawns of forces they don&#39;t understand.
They take their preferences as given fact,
never grasping value&#39;s creating hand.</p>
<p>They think the world must be as it appears,
that economic law is like the stone.
But human action conquers all such fears—
each choice creates the world we call our own.</p>
<p>Entrepreneur of your own existence, rise!
See means and ends with calculating mind.
But calculate toward greatness—not the lies
of comfort that leave sovereignty behind.</p>
<p>Each action is a vote for what shall be—
choose, act, and shape reality.</p>
<hr>
<p>They cling to what exists, afraid of change,
preferring the security of chains.
The new, the different, seems to them so strange—
they&#39;d rather keep their losses than make gains.</p>
<p>But static life is death by other name,
and safety is illusion after all.
Creative destruction is the game—
old orders must perpetually fall.</p>
<p>Embrace the market of ideas and dreams!
Let competition forge your better self.
Nothing is sacred as it sometimes seems—
create new value, not protective shelf.</p>
<p>The mediocre masses fear the cost,
but you know staying still means being lost.</p>
<hr>
<p>The anointed speak in cosmic sweeping terms,
their vision unconstrained by fact or proof.
The masses follow, comfortable as worms,
preferring pretty lies to bitter truth.</p>
<p>They signal virtue while they sacrifice
the real for the ideal&#39;s empty glow,
paying in freedom for what sounds so nice,
never asking what they need to know.</p>
<p>But you—constrain your vision by the real!
Knowledge takes courage that the masses lack.
Trade-offs exist no matter how you feel,
and wisdom knows what fervor can&#39;t bring back.</p>
<p>Rise not through fantasies but through what&#39;s true—
the disciplined mind sees what few pursue.</p>
<hr>
<p>They let the collective define their ends,
surrender to the group their very soul.
What &quot;society&quot; wants is what they defend,
never questioning who controls the whole.</p>
<p>Patterned principles become their cage,
they redistribute their own precious life.
Equality of outcome is their wage
for giving up the individual knife.</p>
<p>But you are not a means to others&#39; dreams!
Your life is yours—inviolate, supreme.
Justice is not in engineered schemes
but in the right to chase your own extreme.</p>
<p>Be minimal in what you let them take,
and maximal in what you dare to make.</p>
<hr>
<p>They call it noble to live for another,
to sacrifice their values on demand.
Altruism makes them slave to every brother,
while their own greatness withers in their hand.</p>
<p>The second-hander lives through others&#39; eyes,
produces nothing, creates no new light.
Their mediocrity they dramatize
as virtue, making weakness seem like might.</p>
<p>But rational self-interest is the way!
Not whims, but values held with logic&#39;s force.
Create, achieve, let your own judgment say
what&#39;s worthy of your limited life&#39;s course.</p>
<p>The parasite condemns the productive soul—
but you know making value is the goal.</p>
<hr>
<p>The gray tide rises, threatening to drown
all excellence in its democratic flood.
The levelers would pull all greatness down,
make all achievement mix with common mud.</p>
<p>But we who&#39;ve heard these voices crying out
from philosophy&#39;s most daring peaks—
we know what human greatness is about,
we know the glory that the hero seeks.</p>
<p>Not in the herd&#39;s acceptance will we find
our human worth, our reason to exist.
But in the courage of the sovereign mind
that dares to clench life in its burning fist.</p>
<p>The war against mediocrity begins
within each soul that chooses: lose or win.</p>
<p>Choose greatness. Choose the difficult ascent.
Choose to be more than time and comfort spent.
The world may die in whimpers, but not you—
roar into being. Make the darkness new.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>&quot;The individual has always had to struggle to keep from being overwhelmed by the tribe. If you try it, you will be lonely often, and sometimes frightened. But no price is too high to pay for the privilege of owning yourself.&quot;</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Behold! The call to mediocrity—that ancient poison, that primordial attack upon all great men and their legacies—is as old as resentment itself! Since first a cave-dweller glimpsed his superior fashioning fire whilst he cowered in darkness, the herd hath conspired to drag down every eagle to the level of sheep.</p>
<p>How laughable—nay, how <em>pitiable</em>—to exist without ascending! To breathe without expanding! To wake each morrow only to shuffle through the same worn grooves as yesterday&#39;s somnambulists! These last men, these blinking comfort-seekers who say &quot;We have invented happiness&quot; whilst they huddle in their temperature-controlled boxes, consuming their little pleasures and their little truths—oh, how they make one&#39;s gorge rise!</p>
<p>They dare to call their cowardice &quot;wisdom,&quot; their weakness &quot;morality,&quot; their fear of heights &quot;sensibility&quot;! They have made a virtue of their own diminishment, a religion of their own failure to grow. &quot;Why strive?&quot; they whimper. &quot;Why suffer for greatness when we might be comfortable in our littleness?&quot; They poison the wells of ambition with their slave-morality, crying &quot;Blessed are the meek!&quot; whilst secretly gnashing their teeth at every soul that dares to soar.</p>
<p>Mark well these specimens of décadence: the man who &quot;knows his place,&quot; who speaks in borrowed thoughts and received opinions, who measures his worth by his similarity to others! See how he scuttles from one petty pleasure to the next, mistaking his appetites for a personality, his routines for a life! He reads what everyone reads, thinks what everyone thinks, and calls this rabble-wisdom &quot;being informed.&quot; He has never had a thought that made him dizzy, never felt an idea that threatened to shatter his world—and he is <em>proud</em> of this poverty!</p>
<p>And their highest aspiration? To be &quot;nice&quot;! To cause no offense! To rock no boats! They have made a supreme value of <em>harmlessness</em>—as if the absence of vigor were itself virtuous! They congregate in their committees and their communities, these last men, reinforcing each other&#39;s mediocrity, awarding prizes for the most successful maintenance of the status quo. &quot;Another day without excellence!&quot; they might as well cheer. &quot;Another year without disturbing the peace of our putrefaction!&quot;</p>
<p>But thou who hast ears to hear—canst thou not perceive the comedy? These creatures who fear solitude because they cannot bear their own company, who fear silence because it might reveal their emptiness, who fear greatness because it exposes their own refusal to grow—they dare to legislate for the eagles! They dare to say what is &quot;reasonable,&quot; what is &quot;balanced,&quot; what is &quot;healthy&quot;! The sick prescribing medicine to the vital! The halt and lame establishing the rules for dancers!</p>
<p>Oh, let them have their &quot;life-work balance&quot; and their &quot;sustainable pace&quot; and their &quot;realistic expectations&quot;! Let them cuddle together in their support groups, validating each other&#39;s decision to remain larvae! But for those with blood still hot enough to boil, with spirits still wild enough to hunger—know that their tolerance is <em>fear</em>, their inclusivity is <em>envy</em>, their community is <em>conspiracy against greatness</em>.</p>
<p>The war is ancient but the battle is NOW! Every moment thou choosest comfort over growth, thou dost betray every ancestor who bled to make thee possible. Every time thou seekest the average, the median, the &quot;normal,&quot; thou dost spit upon the grave of every genius who suffered to expand what is human.</p>
<p>Rise, or be forever complicit in humanity&#39;s heat-death! Create, or be counted among the graves that walk! The mediocre have always been the majority—but since when did the eagle take voting advice from sheep?</p>
<p>Let the world grow—but it grows only through those who grow beyond it! The rest? Let them tend their little gardens of adequacy. We have mountains to make.</p>
