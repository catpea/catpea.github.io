            <p>The one thing about working out at the gym,
that nobody readies you for.</p>
<p>Is that all your workout clothes will get worn out,
in less than three months…</p>
<p>And you will change shape,
so that even your street clothes will need an update.</p>
<p>So here I am am, with a looming expedition,
to find a shirt somewhere.</p>
<p>Reminiscing about all the times,
when frankly, things gout out of hand.</p>
<hr>
<p>As far as I can tell, I have no formal education,
as far as proper shopping is concerned.</p>
<p>So, I just do my best,
though secretly suspecting I am a feral shopper.</p>
<p>For one, I don’t know if other people,
return things when things get mixed up in their favor.</p>
<p>I am sure, it is the morally right thing to do,
but, are people doing it? I just don’t know.</p>
<hr>
<p>Most recently, I gave the cashier three dollars,
upon telling her that I received two extra spices.</p>
<p>It was a dollar too much, because I was thinking about a full refund,
which would have been three dollars.</p>
<p>But she very energetically grabbed the money,
and showed it in the register, and it was too late.</p>
<p>I started with two extra dollars,
and now I was a dollar short.</p>
<hr>
<p>Few months prior, after a beef jerky expedition,
I discovered that I owned two colorful bottles of nail polish.</p>
<p>I remembered that the person ahead of me,
was a heavy set woman in a wheelchair.</p>
<p>But, after an hour passed,
what good would that do.</p>
<p>After a day or two, I returned them,
and the cashier wanted to give me two dollars.</p>
<p>I said no, I am sure I didn’t pay for them,
the bag belonged to the lady ahead of me.</p>
<p>I spared the cashier the description of the woman,
because even though it is morally right to return the items…</p>
<p>I could tell the cashier was slightly pissed off,
that I am bothering her with moral bullshit.</p>
<hr>
<p>Couple of years before that,
I was explaining to a young lady at a clothing store.</p>
<p>That there was a mistake of over 20 bucks,
but I don’t have the receipt.</p>
<p>And she looked at me, and I looked at her,
and she limitedly asked “Was it in your favor?”</p>
<p>See, it took her a single glance,
of actually looking at the damn customer…</p>
<p>And not merely register her daily blur,
of passing shoppers...</p>
<p>To immediately figure out,
that it was moral bullshit again.</p>
<p>And she just turned away,
cashed me out, and I was on my way.</p>
<p>She had nothing to add,
and I was made to feel nothing but shame.</p>
<p>I don’t save my receipts, but I think if I had the receipt,
she would have though even less of me.</p>
<p>It wasn’t my money,
it is not fair to keep it.</p>
<p>It isn’t,
I am not that kind of person.</p>
<hr>
<p>About a decade and half before that,
there was another incident.</p>
<p>Which I am too ashamed to describe in any detail,
but I wanted to do the right thing without a question, immediately.</p>
<p>I was told not to, and quickly farried away from the store.
it was also about $20 dollars, but it was all my horrible fault….</p>
<p>Because coughing up money on a new laptop,
made me nervous - and evidently brainless.</p>
<hr>
<p>I must interject here my favorite story, from maybe a decade and half ago.
where I for one, didn’t start the event.</p>
<p>I was just buying a singe tub of ice cream,
hoping to stay under the radar, and get on with my day.</p>
<p>And the heavy set woman at the register,
snapped me out of my get on with the day hypnosis.</p>
<p>By asking me “Do you want a paper bag so that the ice cream,
doesn’t met in my hot little hands?”</p>
<p>I looked at her, and blinked,
while trying to figure out if I was in some kind of a danger.</p>
<p>She was of the age, where her own children probably already had teenagers,
and there she was, a serious and mature woman, with a proper family.</p>
<p>Up to something…
bless her heart.</p>
<hr>
<p>But this isn’t the shopping trouble that I want to curse my self with,
by sharing with the world.</p>
<p>The event that was on my mind,
actually ended in a perfect stunned silence.</p>
<hr>
<p>Being a feral shopper, as I am,
and slowly becoming well proportioned from my workouts.</p>
<p>I developed a tendency to search for,
clothes that fit me well.</p>
<p>I don’t like items of clothing that seem too large,
I like a snug fit.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am ashamed to admit, that somehow,
I made the discovery that in America…</p>
<p>There is in fact a second isle with well fitting,
clothes for men.</p>
<p>And that is the fat kids isle,
which often has loose fitting clothes for obese children.</p>
<p>Which I kid you not, are not only colorful,
but perfect for body builders.</p>
<p>For some reason, loose fitting clothes,
are cut in such a way that the shoulder and upper arm area is exaggerated.</p>
<p>This means that a fat kid jacket, will fit my large shoulders snugly,
and being child sized, not seem baggy at all.</p>
<p>Plus the added bonus,
of fancy colors, that you can’t find in the adult section.</p>
<p>My favorite autumn jackets, is from a kids isle,
and though my shoulders grew in last couple of years.</p>
<p>It still fits me perfectly, I mean like perfectly,
color wise it is also non symmetrical…</p>
<p>It has a huge green triangular motif,
pointy on the left side, and covering my arm on the right.</p>
<p>If it wasn’t for the “Fat Cub Scout Camp – Fat 12 Year Old Unite” shoulder patch,
it would seem like I bout the thing in Paris.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, what I didn’t realize, what didn’t occur to me,
being the kind of a shopper that I am.</p>
<p>Is that trying on kids clothes,
will get you noticed by the people that work there.</p>
<p>They probably don’t know that fat kids clothes,
fit men with large shoulders really well.</p>
<p>So I grabbed some stuff to try on in-front of a mirror,
and proudly walked int the changing to see what I look like in a mirror.</p>
<p>I usually program all day, and shop late,
so it was closing hour.</p>
<p>And the young ladies that worked there,
walked by the changing area asking if anybody needed help.</p>
<p>I am assuming, they were just checking,
how many people were using changing rooms.</p>
<p>But to me it was a weird question,
so I jokingly replied:</p>
<p>“I am glad you are asking, because I was trying on some ridiculously tight jackets,
worried that I’d get stuck.”.</p>
<p>And you know what she said: nothing,
the area went from cheerful and energetic, to emptiness and silence.</p>
<p>As she tried not to laugh out loud at,
at the guy that was in the fat kids section earlier.</p>
<p>I only tried to make a little joke,
but got the sense that a bigger one was already at play.</p>
<p>I haven’t been to the fat kids section, since,
but I still think it is a great idea.</p>
<hr>
<p>Though not as great as how I am able to reliably find bodybuilder shirts,
a story that is growing more embarrassing by the year.</p>
<p>And eventually is sure to wake me up at 3:30AM,
wishing I was a more serious person.</p>
<p>I looked everywhere for decent sleeveless workout shirts,
that don’t have that wheat bag feel to them, and they were nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>I started getting the distinct impression that 1990s, and the age of WWF,
Commando and Rambo was over, and people were T-shirts now.</p>
<p>Until I discovered, that all the sleeveless shirts were simply moved,
to the women&#39;s section.</p>
<p>Where, I found myself uneasily browsing,
and occasionally stretching a poor shirt before I could eyeball the size.</p>
<p>This is where a young woman, wearing enough make up,
to put Cleopatra to shame jumped out of the bra section behind me…</p>
<p>And gave me - a rather shy person,
a much deserved accusing look.</p>
<p>There being no time to explain what I am up to,
I figured I should just get going.</p>
<p>But just to be nice,
I tried to make a joke right as I was turning to leave.</p>
<p>And this; is where I discovered, that when I get nervous,
I begin speaking in something reminiscent of southern accent.</p>
<p>I hurriedly blurted out, “I am just not that kind of maAan”,
and have since been purchasing all my workout shirts... from the internet.</p>
