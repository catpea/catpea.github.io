            <p>Preface</p>
<p>I aim to remind you,
not to be tricked into not leaving a profound legacy.</p>
<p>One of your own making,
one that you earned by facing hard challenges in life.</p>
<p>So that not until it came to last of your days,
did you discover, that you didn&#39;t need to end, that you could transform.</p>
<p>Into voice,
and wisdom.</p>
<p>This is not about a childish fear of dying,
but honoring those who care about you.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t get tricked,
out of leaving a profound legacy.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have unfinished business,
and I don&#39;t know where it starts or where it ends.</p>
<p>But I do know it is important,
it is a duty, I have.</p>
<p>I dare say,
it is a duty we each have.</p>
<hr>
<p>Four strange evens led me here,
and here they a re in order.</p>
<p>Some strange mother, thought it would be cute,
to raise her young boy, now a man.</p>
<p>Believing that fairies were real,
and I heard him explain that they were stealing sugar in his house.</p>
<p>This made me very sad,
it upset me.</p>
<hr>
<p>A congregation got bussed,
to wideness I was staying at.</p>
<p>And a Bonnie Lass thought to convert a lonesome heathen,
as he sat alone, away from humanity.</p>
<p>Our conversation ended, when she said,
in front of her significant other.</p>
<p>That her boyfriend may end up cheating on her,
but the god of the fantasy she was born into, never would.</p>
<hr>
<p>Then two brothers raised buy a pastor mother,
got very upset when I told them the world was not ending.</p>
<p>The short one, he just needs to get a wife,
like she was some doll.</p>
<p>And the tall one, ended up hitting his head,
when I explained nuclear power is not evil.</p>
<p>The gold he wore around his neck,
came from the center of a second generation sun.</p>
<p>Whereas Earth life emerged,
to a third generation star, or sun.</p>
<hr>
<p>And of course, there is my curse,
I failed all my classes.</p>
<p>Because I rejected,
pretending to learn by memorization.</p>
<p>I wanted to learn math, and the silences,
the way I learned programming.</p>
<p>And not a single teacher,
tried to stop him self from marking me down.</p>
<hr>
<p>I call this my unfinished business,
Now with Mr. Dennett having passed away.</p>
<p>With Sir Ken Robinson and Mr Hitchens,
still breaking my heart.</p>
<p>I think we all have unfinished business,
and whether we will see a cure for aging in our lifetimes, or not.</p>
<p>Bears little consequence, on the body of work we are each charged with,
whether it becomes a legacy or not.</p>
<p>We must each build, a pesonal monument,
to share our un-contradictory wisdom.</p>
<p>It is a matter of dignity, and decency,
and love of life.</p>
<p>And assuring those who enjoy our presence that we are as close,
as a link to an auto book that captured the best of our ideas.</p>
<p>And the more books we write,
the higher the height we help others to.</p>
<p>Like becoming a philosopher,
the body of work that captures your ideas, is not optional.</p>
<p>And you have to make sure, that as adventurers take you on adventure,
whether you are still around, or they reignite your spirit by exploring your narrated book.</p>
<p>That when they return from their adventure,
they will stand taller, precisely because what you helped them remember, or learn.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Legacy And The Spire</p>
<hr>
<p>A spire,
is a neat representation of inheritance and growth.</p>
<p>You can view it as the progress Humanity has made,
the giant&#39;s upon whose shoulders we stand, and that there is more to come.</p>
<p>And a Person&#39;s personal growth,
well on top of their intellectual inheritance, as they add more and more.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can also imagine the height of a person,
who did not rise to the shoulders of giants.</p>
<p>Or whose education was subverted,
and made irrelevant, ineffective, inferior, or just meaningless.</p>
<hr>
<p>And even more than that, a spire, is a reminder,
that we must all grow all the way up.</p>
<p>And discover that as we each bring light to new heights,
the end to our rise will never be in sight.</p>
<p>Each generation will begin where the previous retired,
and rise to heights that the previous generation could not yet imagine.</p>
<p>You can see how Cowboys would have difficulty imagining,
portable computers.</p>
<p>They could very well grasp, a wireless telegraph,
but a smartphone required more than they could leap.</p>
<hr>
<p>Very strange things happen, when you ask,
what if a person from 1776 was born today.</p>
<p>Because then you realize,
they would be just like the rest of us.</p>
<p>And what is a person from today,
was tricked to grow up in a simulated 1776 time period.</p>
<p>You see they would have trouble,
with their imagination.</p>
<hr>
<p>The difference education makes,
re-writes a persons mind.</p>
<p>Teaching a child that they will go to heaven,
to meet their family.</p>
<p>At a time when very big companies,
are bringing artificial intelligence to biology.</p>
<p>Is becoming ever more questionable,
with AI, no longer decade by decade, but month by month.</p>
<p>Shortcuts you see, always come at a price,
and sometimes as terrible, as giving up longevity therapy for a fantasy.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even more down to earth, raising a child under any religion,
alters how they view the world, and what questions they ask.</p>
<p>It reshapes their natural curiosity, perhaps makes then territorial,
certainly less prone to asking the big questions.</p>
<p>We are here, due to the endless complexity of the universe,
the experiment of life, is happening in many places, under various conditions.</p>
<p>We can be sure that emergence of life is not guaranteed,
that the accidents Murray Gell-Mann mentions must be of just the right kind.</p>
<p>That it is more than just the fundamental principles,
of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, things have to just right.</p>
<p>And when we consider this, we grasp how many times,
the experiment of life, and likely universe had failed to paraphrase Edward P. Tryon.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is no mystery here, On 7 January in 1610 Galileo observed the moons of Jupiter,
moons like our moon, just about 60 years after the publication of Copernicus&#39; Revolutions.</p>
<p>In 1616, the leading religion at the time, declared helocentrism,
as &quot;formally heretical&quot;, De Revolutionibus was banned until 1758.</p>
<p>So on January 7th, in 1610 another world, with moons is observed,
and not until 1758, 148 years later, did the church unban the book.</p>
<p>The shortcut of a simple universe in favor of humanity,
yanked us, and human progress back a 150 years.</p>
<p>Giordano Bruno early adopter of the Revolutions,
simply connected that starts and the sun are bright.</p>
<p>And predicted the existence of exoplanets,
guessed that stars were suns.</p>
<p>Deemed too heretical in all his beliefs,
he was burned by small mined men ten years before Galileo observed the moons.</p>
<hr>
<p>That our children are unsure if religion is real or not,
and that people gamble, saying that it is better to believe in gods just in case, as in Pascal&#39;s Wager.</p>
<p>Is an insult,
to the giants upon whose shoulders we stand today.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as a Republican, Democratic, Left or Right Child,
and there shouldn&#39;t be such thing as a Religious child, either.</p>
<p>Parents, families and congregations, do not have the right to rewrite brains,
and when they dabble in the warping of a mind, they give up more than they can imagine.</p>
<hr>
<p>Marx, wrote that Religion is the Opium of the people,
I add that the price for shortcuts is immeasurably great.</p>
<hr>
<p>For our minds to properly function,
our beliefs must be well connected, and un-contradictory.</p>
<p>Driving shortcuts and fantasies into a person&#39;s mind,
is the tool of the slavers.</p>
<p>Who kept facts such as that cities exist,
secret.</p>
<p>And uttered that terrible phrase,
that a learned servant is a no good servant.</p>
<p>A phrase echoed today, by cunning manipulators,
but now decorated as &quot;education is white&quot;.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tolerance of ineffective education, or intolerance of education,
is a terrible curse, that yet again, will yank humanity back centuries.</p>
<p>There once was a battle raging for clarity of thought,
but each time the attacker came close to losing, it assumed a more pleasing shape.</p>
<p>There is much more to the unbanning of De Revolutionibus,
than am ere call to celebration, of the progression of the zeitgeist.</p>
<p>It is a war strategy, in a war so petty, it is simply unbelievable,
a war about a little bit of coin from a great number of people kept in the dark.</p>
<hr>
<p>We have come a full circle from the last century,
again facing a Nuclear War, well three actually.</p>
<p>What was once a deterrent, is now on the menu,
as it is better understood, somewhat cleaner in the minds of little men.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is not the work of nations, or leaders,
or men of any greatness.</p>
<p>It is a symptom,
of the parasite of un-education,</p>
<p>The wish to win a war, to keep fighting is a noble one,
but it does not grant meaning to the war it self.</p>
<p>Because what is preventable today,
once it occurs out of ignorance, cannot have a meaning.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is a large intellectual inheritance waiting for you at the library,
without which your thinking will not be as it should be.</p>
<p>All of the books worth your time, are free and well narrated,
each of those books, begs you, that you take a long relaxing vacation to properly hear it.</p>
<p>They ask NOTHING OF YOU,
they just want to give.</p>
<p>Like all the thoughts in your mind are connected,
so are your children to your ways.</p>
<p>The clearer your thinking,
the higher their start on the spire.</p>
<p>The shorter the journey to the top,
where they can add another layer to help others rise higher.</p>
<p>It is time to lay the shortcuts aside,
and accept the responsibility for a powerful body of knowledge.</p>
<p>Your life must not end on your last day,
that should be a new beginning to the new you.</p>
<p>The great legacy,
that you leave behind.</p>
<p>Do not just exit the world,
leave the best of you for those who will miss you in the shape of books.</p>
<p>Books you should narrate with your own voice,
so that yo are always there, when needed.</p>
<p>Therefore, grow, rise all the way up,
until you become a great being.</p>
<p>Laying down a path,
for others to begin, where you leave off.</p>
