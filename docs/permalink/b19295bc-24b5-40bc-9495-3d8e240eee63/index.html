<hr>
<p>My fellow human beings—not citizens of this nation or that, not consumers, not voters, not &quot;demographics&quot; to be analyzed and manipulated—but <em>human beings</em>, heirs to ten thousand years of struggle, sacrifice, and the slow, aching reach toward something higher:</p>
<p>I speak to you tonight as a voice—one voice among billions—that refuses to be silent while the very meaning of human life is hollowed out and sold back to us as contentment.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="i-on-the-metrics-of-misery">I. On the Metrics of Misery</h2>
<p>We are told the world is being measured.</p>
<p>The World Happiness Report ranks nations by their satisfaction. The Doomsday Clock ticks toward midnight, warning us of annihilation. Economists chart our gross domestic product, our consumer confidence, our quarterly growth.</p>
<p>But I ask you: <em>Who is measuring our greatness?</em></p>
<p>Who is asking whether this generation will produce its Aristotle, its Ayn Rand, its Marie Curie? Who is counting the geniuses we have buried in poverty before they could speak? Who is accounting for the philosophers we have turned into file clerks, the poets we have made into addicts, the revolutionaries of the spirit we have numbed with screens and noise and the endless repetition of <em>buy, consume, obey, be small</em>?</p>
<p>The Doomsday Clock tells us we may die. It does not ask whether we have <em>lived</em>.</p>
<p>The Happiness Report tells us we are satisfied. It does not ask whether we have become <em>worthy</em> of satisfaction.</p>
<p>And so I say to you: these metrics are not merely inadequate. They are <em>obscene</em>. They measure the temperature of a corpse and call it health. They count the chains and call them bracelets.</p>
<p>A human being is not born to be <em>satisfied</em>. A human being is born to be <em>great</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="ii-on-the-hollow-words-of-small-men">II. On the Hollow Words of Small Men</h2>
<p>We have heard our leaders speak.</p>
<p>We have heard them invoke courage in speeches written by committees, delivered between fundraisers, forgotten by morning. We have heard a world leader—a grown man, charged with the fate of millions—say that &quot;stories of the triumph of courage over adversity give me hope.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Stories</em> give him hope.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he signs the orders. Meanwhile, young men are fitted for uniforms. Meanwhile, the machinery of war grinds forward, and the speaker of hopeful stories sleeps well, for he has <em>satisfied him self with the correct words</em>.</p>
<p>And when we ask—when we dare to ask—whether in this age of artificial intelligence, of automation, of unimaginable productive capacity, whether perhaps every human being might be guaranteed the basic dignity of survival, the basic foundation from which to <em>grow</em>—we are told, with a wave of the hand, &quot;It&#39;s not going to happen.&quot;</p>
<p><em>It&#39;s not going to happen.</em></p>
<p>This is not governance. This is <em>surrender</em>—the surrender of imagination, the abdication of responsibility, the confession that those who rule us cannot envision a world better than the one that made them rich.</p>
<p>Let me say plainly what such words reveal: a feeble mind dressed in fine clothes; a small soul with a large title; a <em>servant</em> who has forgotten he serves.</p>
<p>For what is a politician but a servant? What is a leader but one who <em>leads</em>—not toward comfort, but toward greatness? Not toward the preservation of power, but toward the liberation of human potential?</p>
<p>The ancient philosophers knew this. The founders of republics knew this. Somewhere along the way, we forgot—or were made to forget.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, we will digress for a moment, we will interject here, words that are holy, a caution and curse, that evil, can only beget evil.</p>
<p>Our best attempt at reconstructing these words, is built atop what can only be described as &quot;cruel historical silence&quot; our best effort, is reaching back to an inspeakable tragedy, through litte more than wisdom it self. But that is not to say that the being that is about to speak was small, she was not.</p>
<p>&quot;Cherry Turner&#39;s voice was taken from us by history. But we can imagine what she might have said—to honor the wisdom that slavery tried to destroy. In the tradition of Toni Morrison, August Wilson, and all who have given voice to the silenced, these are the words we offer in her name...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;You think the lash teaches me?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The lash teaches <em>you</em>.</strong></p>
<p>**Every blow you strike writes a lesson on your own soul—a lesson you cannot unlearn. You are teaching your children that a human being is a thing to be broken. And your children will learn. And they will become what you have made them: small men, masters of nothing, terrified of the very people they have chained.</p>
<p>You have stolen my husband&#39;s body. You have sold my children like sacks of grain. You have beaten me until I cannot stand. But <em>you</em> are the ones in bondage now—bound to a way of life that requires you to be monsters, bound to a lie so large you must defend it with every breath, bound to a darkness that is eating you from within.</p>
<p>I have seen your sons. I have watched them learn cruelty at their fathers&#39; knees. I have watched them become less human with each passing year. This is the price you pay for what you have built: not only our suffering, but <em>your own diminishment</em>. You are becoming slaves to your own machinery—slaves to the whip, slaves to the auction block, slaves to the terror that your evil might one day be repaid.</p>
<p>You call us ignorant. But we <em>know</em>. We know what you have done. We know what you are becoming. And one day, your children&#39;s children will look back at you and see not masters, but the most pitiful of slaves—men who sold their souls for cotton, who traded their humanity for power over bodies they could never truly own.</p>
<p>My husband saw visions. I have seen further than any vision.</p>
<p>I have seen what you are building: a nation that will tear itself apart over what you have done here. I have seen your grandchildren ashamed to speak your names. I have seen the long shadow you are casting—a shadow that will darken your own descendants for generations.</p>
<p>You think you are punishing me.</p>
<p>You are <em>becoming the punishment</em>.</p>
<p>Strike me again, if you must. Every blow is a confession. Every scar you leave on my body is a scar you are carving into your own history. And history does not forget.</p>
<p>We who have been broken—we will be remembered as those who endured.</p>
<p>But you who did the breaking?</p>
<p>You will be remembered as those who <em>became the thing they worshipped</em>: chains and darkness and the machinery of smallness, passed down from father to son, forever.</p>
<p>I pity you.</p>
<p>And I curse you with the only curse that matters:</p>
<p><em>May you get exactly what you are building.</em></p>
<p>May you live long enough to see it.&quot;**</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="iii-on-the-engineering-of-ignorance">III. On the Engineering of Ignorance</h2>
<p>Let us speak now of how we were made to forget.</p>
<p>It did not happen by accident. Ignorance on this scale is not a natural disaster. It is an <em>achievement</em>—a centuries-long project, executed with precision, funded with intention, and maintained with ruthless efficiency.</p>
<p><strong>The Direct Method:</strong> Control what is taught.</p>
<p>We have seen it before. The anti-literacy laws of the slaveholding South, which made it a crime to teach a human being to read—because reading leads to thinking, and thinking leads to freedom. The Bantu Education Act of apartheid, which designed a curriculum explicitly to produce servants, not citizens. The book burnings of tyrants who understood that a single dangerous idea, planted in a single mind, could bring down empires.</p>
<p>But the direct method is crude. It leaves evidence. It creates martyrs.</p>
<p><strong>The Indirect Method:</strong> Control what is <em>possible</em> to learn.</p>
<p>This is the refinement. This is the modern art.</p>
<p>You do not ban books. You simply ensure that the schools which might teach them are underfunded, understaffed, and overcrowded. You do not prohibit critical thinking. You simply ensure the curriculum is so packed with rote memorization, so obsessed with standardized tests, so stripped of philosophy and history and art, that critical thinking never develops.</p>
<p>You do not forbid genius. You simply make it economically impossible for most children to become geniuses.</p>
<p>A child born into poverty is not <em>legally</em> prevented from becoming Aristotle. But when that child must work, must care for siblings, must survive in neighborhoods designed for desperation—when that child&#39;s school has no library, no laboratory, no teacher who stays longer than two years—when that child has never once been told that <em>greatness is possible</em>, that <em>greatness is their birthright</em>—then you have achieved prohibition without the inconvenience of a law.</p>
<p>And over all of this, you spread a myth. A poison. A lie so effective it has conquered the world:</p>
<p><em>Only a few are capable of genius.</em></p>
<p>This is the foundational lie of every aristocracy that has ever existed. It was told by kings to justify their crowns. It was told by slaveholders to justify their whips. It is told today by systems that depend on a permanent underclass—told so often, and so smoothly, that even those it damages have come to believe it.</p>
<p>I am here to tell you: <em>it is a lie</em>.</p>
<p>Every child born into this world carries the seed of greatness. Every human mind, given sunlight and water and room to grow, can flower into something magnificent. The tragedy is not that genius is rare. The tragedy is that we have built a world which <em>makes it rare</em>—and then congratulates itself on identifying the few who survive.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="iv-on-the-carousel-of-the-wealthy">IV. On the Carousel of the Wealthy</h2>
<p>And who has built this world?</p>
<p>Look at the halls of power. Look at the legislatures, the cabinets, the executive mansions. Count the millionaires. Count the sons and daughters of millionaires. Count those who have never missed a meal, never feared an eviction, never worked a job that broke their body or their spirit.</p>
<p>In the wealthiest nation on Earth, the United States Congress holds a median net worth that would take an average worker <em>lifetimes</em> to accumulate. In nations around the world, the pattern repeats: the halls of power are filled with those born to comfort, educated in exclusivity, insulated since birth from the realities they are meant to govern.</p>
<p>These are the men and women who speak of &quot;Joe Sixpack&quot; without flinching—without recognizing that the phrase itself is an insult, a reduction of a human being to a stereotype of ignorance and cheap beer. They do not understand that the man they mock was not <em>born</em> uneducated. He was <em>made</em> uneducated—by the schools they defunded, by the wages they suppressed, by the futures they foreclosed.</p>
<p>They speak of poverty as though it were a character flaw. They speak of ignorance as though it were a choice. They do not understand—<em>they cannot understand</em>—that poverty is a <em>policy</em>, and ignorance is its intended result.</p>
<p>A politician is meant to be a servant. In the ancient world, the word meant <em>one who attends to the affairs of the city</em>—not for profit, but for duty. The philosopher Plato argued that those least eager for power were those most fit to wield it. Confucius taught that the ruler must first cultivate wisdom in himself before he could cultivate virtue in his people.</p>
<p>Where are these servants now? Where are the philosopher-statesmen, the wise counselors, the leaders who read and think and struggle with the great questions of existence?</p>
<p>They have been replaced by the <em>small man</em>—the man who understands nothing but the mechanics of winning, the man who mistakes wealth for wisdom and power for purpose. And the small man, by his nature, wishes to keep all others small. He does not raise the people up. He holds them down—because he fears what they might become if they were allowed to grow.</p>
<h2 id="v-a-call-to-greatness">V. A Call to Greatness</h2>
<p>And so I call to you now—not to anger, not to despair, not to the easy rage that changes nothing—but to <em>greatness</em>.</p>
<p>I call to the young, who have been told their dreams are impractical, who have been handed a world of debts and wars and dying systems: <em>You are not too young to be great. Alexander wept at thirty that there were no more worlds to conquer. Mozart composed symphonies as a child. You carry within you the same fire that burned in every genius of history. Do not let them extinguish it.</em></p>
<p>I call to the old, who have been told their time has passed, who have been set aside as obsolete: <em>You are not too old to be great. Socrates was seventy when he drank the hemlock rather than betray wisdom. Mandela was seventy-five when he became president. Your years are not a burden; they are a treasury. Share what you have learned.</em></p>
<p>I call to the poor, who have been told they lack the resources for greatness: <em>Poverty is not your failure; it is theirs. Every obstacle placed before you is evidence of how much they fear your rising. You were not born to serve their economy. You were born to outgrow it.</em></p>
<p>I call to the politicians, the legislators, the executives—yes, even to you: <em>Remember what you were supposed to be. Not a manager of decline. Not a servant of donors. But a servant of the people—a philosopher in action, a steward of human potential. History remembers few presidents, few prime ministers. But it remembers every leader who lifted humanity higher. You still have time. Choose to be remembered.</em></p>
<p>And I call to everyone who hears these words, in whatever nation, in whatever circumstance, in whatever state of hope or despair:</p>
<p><em>You are not meant to be small.</em></p>
<p>You are not meant to be satisfied with satisfaction. You are not meant to measure your life by the metrics of those who profit from your smallness. You are not a consumer, a demographic, a data point, a voter to be engineered.</p>
<p>You are a human being—heir to Prometheus who stole fire from the gods, heir to every rebel and saint and genius who refused to accept the world as it was, heir to ten billion ancestors who survived against all odds so that you could be here, now, reading these words.</p>
<p>The greatness they carried lives in you.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="vii-a-final-word">VII. A Final Word</h2>
<p>The words have been spoken. The call has been made. And somewhere, someone is hearing it.</p>
<p>Not everyone will answer. Most will return to their screens, their distractions, their managed lives. The small men will continue to rule, for a time. The machinery of ignorance will grind on, for a time.</p>
<p>But <em>not forever</em>.</p>
<p>Because ideas cannot be killed. Because the truth, once spoken, echoes. Because somewhere, in some forgotten classroom, in some impoverished home, in some prison cell, in some corner of the world the powerful have written off—someone is waking up.</p>
<p>Someone is deciding to be great.</p>
<p><em>&quot;They tried to bury us. They did not know we were seeds.&quot;</em>
— Mexican proverb</p>
