            <p>You don’t have bad grades,
you have insane teachers.
– Abraham Lincoln</p>
<p>To learn something for real,
you need three things.</p>
<hr>
<p>One, You have to be really, really curious,
about the thing.</p>
<p>If you are not curious, you will not learn,
you will only memorize for long enough to pass a test.</p>
<p>You will be made to sell out for a GPA,
so that your teacher can continue the charade and get paid.</p>
<p>Tricking you into memorization, aside from being utterly useless,
is extremely unethical, because it disables your mind.</p>
<p>To take good old math as example,
not only memorization does nothing for you.</p>
<p>Watching you recalling a formula that you don’t understand,
is really embarrassing and sad.</p>
<p>You Can’t learn math, because math is not a real subject,
it is a thing that seems like a subject, but it is not.</p>
<p>Similarly the question “Why are we here?” sounds great,
it is impressive, large, coherent, but it is not a real question.</p>
<p>It has been called a silly question,
it is a really good signal for a therapist, nit not a real question.</p>
<p>The field of mathematics exists,
you can make a really cool map of it.</p>
<p>But mathematics the class, the set of lectures,
the idea that here is a list of steps you need to learn math, is stupid.</p>
<p>If you have a really good math teacher,
there are two things that block them from helping you.</p>
<p>If you go off script, learn on your own,
away from a textbook, you will fail the final test, or near enough.</p>
<p>And your teacher needs to get paid,
they will do anything to get paid.</p>
<p>They will hold up a textbook with the word math,
and say this is proof math exists.</p>
<p>These are the steps yo need to take, not because it is true,
but because she can hide behind the authority of the book.</p>
<p>It is her way of cutting you off from learning for leal,
so that you shut up and she gets paid.</p>
<p>If she does not get paid, she can’t put food on the table,
she has to look for another job.</p>
<p>Your authentic grasp on mathematics,
does not matter to your teacher.</p>
<p>The only thing that matters,
is the fantasy that you can learn math by memorization.</p>
<p>The only ting that matters is that she checks all the boxes,
so that she gets paid.</p>
<p>And to make sure, you can’t prove a damn thing,
she will prevent herself from ever asking.</p>
<p>Are my kids really learning math,
do textbooks work?</p>
<p>In other words she will be in denial,
she puts up a barrier in her mind, and she will never cross it.</p>
<p>Similarly, members of cuts do this,
they never allow themselves to question the existence of their god or gods.</p>
<p>They reap all the benefits of the community,
without examine anything at any length.</p>
<p>Two, to begin learning something for real,
you need context.</p>
<p>Context is like a busy desk,
when working on something fun.</p>
<p>So schools, destroy, devastate context,
by cutting everything up into time periods.</p>
<p>They do this, to move a large number of students through all the classes,
for the purpose of getting paid.</p>
<p>Working on something and then destroying that context,
nay preventing context from developing.</p>
<p>And then being forced to start learning something else,
will not only ensure that you are memorizing.</p>
<p>But that you are slowly going crazy,
the kids without support, in fact do go crazy.</p>
<p>That is the walk,
the walk from one crowd to the other.</p>
<p>They just give up on who they are,
because they cant make it.</p>
<p>Cigarettes, alcohol, drugs, fighting, dangerous ideas,
cheating lying, strange ideation.</p>
<p>A strange toxicity builds up, between arrogant parents,
and nasty teachers…</p>
<p>Where a lot of kids, are constantly put in the line of fire,
their parents punish, their teachers rob them, and bullies beat them.</p>
<p>All the while being threatened,
by being held back.</p>
<p>Which will make teachers more arrogant towards the student,
make parents more pissed off by being even more inconvenienced.</p>
<p>And fuel bullies to a degree,
where very few bullied kids aren’t turned into bullies themselves.</p>
<p>This constant toxicity, pressure, threat, stress,
makes a person crazy.</p>
<p>If they received a real education,
they would not become crazy.</p>
<p>So the craziness isn’t in them, it is not who they are,
it is that this constant toxicity, pressure, threat, stress, poisons them.</p>
<p>If they do become a bully,
then they are pushed to cross a line, for which they will never forgive themselves.</p>
<p>Deep down they will always think there is something bad in therm,
so like in real life, there are heartbreaking paths of no return here.</p>
<p>If you do have a friend like that,
tell them, that to make their pain count for more,</p>
<p>They can protect others,
from following in their footsteps, it is a path of healing.</p>
<p>Real context is quite a surprise,
because it is rooted in your uniqueness.</p>
<p>You know how you feel different,
that is real, we each have a unique constellation of stars within.</p>
<p>Context is born from that uniqueness,
and the name for that, is curiosity.</p>
<p>To take a year for example,
when you are not poisoned by stress.</p>
<p>You should show a cycle of curiosities,
you start with something neat like buying a cheap 3D pen on sale.</p>
<p>You make a disaster of an art piece,
that doesn’t quite stay up, and something else grabs you by the button.</p>
<p>Maybe listening to the Giants of Philosophy, as read by Charton Heston,
making strange little notes that will look like gibberish in a few weeks.</p>
<p>Then summer comes, and you start putting together a backpack,
tent sleeping bag, and set off on an expedition, to camp in your back yard.</p>
<p>With electricity, to charge your phone,
of course,</p>
<p>Then after a few more curiosities,
you discover, that Winter, has got something to do with your 3D pen.</p>
<p>But now as you dabble in it, you actually create a little something,
that year of few months, made you more capable in reasoning about 3D tings.</p>
<p>You get a Ender 3D printer, couple of spools of PLA,
pritn out a few things from thingiverse.</p>
<p>And boom,
a new star emerges in your constellation of curiosities.</p>
<p>It is so new, and so seemingly unlike you,
that you can’t comprehend how shocking that event is.</p>
<p>Now you are binging on Blender (a free 3D modeling program) tutorials,
about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83yNYScsRPI&amp;list=PL6Fiih6ItYsXzUbBNz7-IvV7UJYHZzCdF">precision modeling for 3D printers</a>.</p>
<p>Might as well order couple of more spools of the PLA,
because creating things out of thin air is something else.</p>
<p>The next time you return to Blender,
after a few months of doing something else.</p>
<p>Your soul is not just ready,
but it is ravenous for mastering geometry nodes.</p>
<p>At this point there is a corner in your house,
a wall of a huge box, filled with strange 3D parts.</p>
<p>You have Blender Keyboard shortcuts up on the wall,
and proudly display the bod in which your automatic bed leveling upgrade came in.</p>
<p>That&#39;s context, that is healthy, that is beautiful,
that is pure genius, and three are many more stars in your constellation.</p>
<p>As you are packing for the Appalachian Trail,
in hopes of Triple Crown, where you additionally walk the PCT and CDT.</p>
<p>Probably re-listening Giants of Philosophy,
as your mind is flourishing far beyond simple constellations.</p>
<p>You don’t know how bad school is,
because you have nothing to compare it against.</p>
<p>You don’t know how swiftly you will age,
the moment you get your perfect job in a cubicle cell.</p>
<p>To quite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9n1F1JupY8">Dixie</a>,
“The worst day at the trail, is still better, then the best day at work.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Three, you need an aim, context will take you far, but it is exploratory,
but you also need a hint of direction.</p>
<p>Now, none is allowed to tell you what that is,
and it is really not that important, but it helps in learning.</p>
<p>In school, you are learning things without an aim,
of if you have one of those teachers…</p>
<p>She will say that you won’t always have a calculator on hand,
to dismiss you like a piece of trash.</p>
<p>On a large scale, aims should be discovered,
just keep on exploring more and more curiosities.</p>
<p>But on a smaller scale, if you give learning mathematics,
an aim that interests you, you will learn it as a side effect.</p>
<p>For example, bring back beautiful screensavers to modern computers,
in the age of generative AI this is more interesting than ever.</p>
<p>The AI will take care of your graphics, or sprites,
and you just need to do the math part – see what I mean.</p>
<p>Two Interesting Screesavers to look at are XscreenSaver on Linux,
and After Dark on the old Mac, it is old software, but lovely.</p>
<p>Here you are learning math and programming,
with the aim of sharing your screensavers with the word.</p>
<p>It is true that we live in a world where people close their laptop lid,
so just make your screensavers that much more interesting.</p>
<p>Alliteratively you can set an aim to learn math and programming,
by building strange things in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&amp;list=PLglp04UYZK_PrN6xWo_nJ-8kzyXDyFUwi">P5.js</a></p>
<p>Make releasing video and book tutorials an aim,
share with eh world what you have learned.</p>
<p>Now in school context, to really learn music,
you need to set an aim of releasing an album in the first semester.</p>
<p>Generative Art AI will take are of your cover,
do your music composition in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sRvkaxh8EU">LMMS</a>,</p>
<p>And witness how much more profound your Music education,
where it creates an aim of releasing a singe minimalist techno album on bandcamp for example.</p>
<p>Music composition with an aim to make songs,
takes a couple of hours to get a hand of.</p>
<p>And <a href="https://learningmusic.ableton.com/">less than two days to compose your first song</a>,
we are all born composers.</p>
<p>It is just that ineffective education,
takes that from us.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, one is curiosity, two is context, three is an aim,
bu there ais also the matter of growing up.</p>
<p>No human being is allowed to grow a lite bit,
nor would anybody want to.</p>
<p>So to grow up, means to grow all the way up, until we become Great Beings,
and on our way there we will find our meaning.</p>
<p>All you need here is a hunger for real knowledge from real books,
written by great beings held in high esteem by all the worlds authentic intellectuals.</p>
<p>In your quest to comprehend their great though,
you will not be able to help, but to enter into their culture.</p>
<p>And eventually in your culture of greatness,
make your own unique contributions to the wold.</p>
<p>As you stand on the shoulders of giants,
and in turn lend yours to countess many that follow.</p>
