            <p>Real teachers are amazing,
they show you our world and bring light to the universe.</p>
<hr>
<p>Fake teachers,
on the other hand.</p>
<p>Threaten you,
be it by holding you back a year…</p>
<p>Or destroying your GPA,
which will affects your entire future.</p>
<p>Or by yelling at you,
or by making the class laugh.</p>
<p>Or the most devilish threat of all,
trick you into thinking that you are stupid…</p>
<p>In front of all the friends,
you ever had.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is a very simple thing the fakers are after,
they don’t want you to understand.</p>
<p>Understanding requires,
that they know what they are doing.</p>
<p>It requires, passion, curiosity, wisdom,
and loving the subject they teach.</p>
<p>The fake teachers,
discover very early on.</p>
<p>That when their curriculum is incomprehensible crap,
you under the many layers of threats, begin memorizing.</p>
<p>It is like a light bulb going off in their head,
teach crap, and they will just memorize and pass all the tests.</p>
<p>They make no effort to integrate what they teach,
they instead scatter it into noise.</p>
<p>They betray you,
and force you into becoming little memorization machines.</p>
<p>The A students are simply desperately memorizing,
you are just as smart as they are, but they didn’t put up a fight.</p>
<hr>
<p>They never knew real education, nobody does, early on,
so they dove right into memorization – after all that is what the teacher wants.</p>
<p>You are up against a massively inconvenienced liar,
they lie that they don’t want you to memorize, and they lie that it is hard work.</p>
<p>Not even a real teacher, but just a decent human being,
would never threaten you with being held back or having your future ruined.</p>
<p>Or call you names behind your back, dunce, hormones, loser,
all the while tricking you into useless memorization, so they can get paid.</p>
<hr>
<p>Real education, real knowledge, touches your heart,
it connects to the constellation of curiosities within you.</p>
<p>Real knowledge flows, like the walls of your house,
close your eyes, and begin moving along the wall starting at the front door.</p>
<p>You will remember everything, outlets, imperfections, and every feature,
that is what real knowledge feels like, you can follow the path in your mind.</p>
<p>What the fake teachers are doing, is pushing you to remember,
other people’s walls, they are making you jump, that is unintegrated knowledge.</p>
<p>You can only hope to memorize it fo the duration of a test,
which is precisely what the teacher wants, memorize for the final, and GTFO.</p>
<hr>
<p>From their perspective,
a perspective that does not cate about you learning anything.</p>
<p>As far as their paycheck is concerned,
memorization is reliable, predictable, dependable, and invisible.</p>
<p>Especially, when they continue asking you, not to just memeorize,
“It is all your fault if you do, foolish child – I told you not to do it, didn’t I?”</p>
<hr>
<p>Your grades are fake too, they want the collective school GPA,
to be average, as not to stick out.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzSnvxejenY">Your grades will be manipulated</a>,
a class will have 1/3 As, 1/3 Bs, 1/3 Cs.</p>
<hr>
<p>You were never dumb.. you were never too dumb to just understand,
there was nothing <strong>to</strong> understand.</p>
<p>You were being coerced into memorization,
under the threat of unethical mind shattering punishment…</p>
<p>Because the teacher was fake,
they didn’t care to teach you, they found an easier way to out food on their table.</p>
<p>The fake teachers,
are the men who sold out the world.</p>
<hr>
<p>You are as smart as History’s smartest beings,
you have the same abilities.</p>
<p>The difference is, they learned on their own, away from stress,
and you were pushed into stress, threats and memorization.</p>
<p>Those are opposite of each other,
you were nowhere near real education.</p>
<hr>
<p>Put an A-Team together, a narrated book club,
thy to hike often, plan to walk the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9n1F1JupY8&amp;pp=ygUQQVQsIFBDVCwgYW5kIENEVA%3D%3D">AT, PCT, and CDT</a>.</p>
<p>(Always as a group, and with extra water filters and satellite communicators,
to go around – baby steps first, try a little wilderness first, sometimes that maybe even enough.)</p>
<p>And read your Poems,
proud and loud – perhaps begin with Whitman’s Kosmos, or The Hacker’s manifesto.</p>
<p>Because there is a simple Universal Rule,
one that must be followed – and the is no choice in the matter.</p>
<p>It especially concerns those who were tricked into fake education,
so listen carefully:</p>
<p>In the absence of teachers,
you must become a Teacher.</p>
<p>You are now charged with glowing all the way up,
until with the wisdom born of your knowledge…</p>
<p>You rise to become a great being,
and help others follow.</p>

                      //The Conscience of a Hacker//

                                      by

                               +++The Mentor+++

                          Written on January 8, 1986
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

        Another one got caught today, it's all over the papers.  "Teenager
Arrested in Computer Crime Scandal", "Hacker Arrested after Bank Tampering"...
        Damn kids.  They're all alike.

        But did you, in your three-piece psychology and 1950's technobrain,
ever take a look behind the eyes of the hacker?  Did you ever wonder what
made him tick, what forces shaped him, what may have molded him?
        I am a hacker, enter my world...
        Mine is a world that begins with school... I'm smarter than most of
the other kids, this crap they teach us bores me...
        Damn underachiever.  They're all alike.

        I'm in junior high or high school.  I've listened to teachers explain
for the fifteenth time how to reduce a fraction.  I understand it.  "No, Ms.
Smith, I didn't show my work.  I did it in my head..."
        Damn kid.  Probably copied it.  They're all alike.

        I made a discovery today.  I found a computer.  Wait a second, this is
cool.  It does what I want it to.  If it makes a mistake, it's because I
screwed it up.  Not because it doesn't like me...
                Or feels threatened by me...
                Or thinks I'm a smart ass...
                Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...
        Damn kid.  All he does is play games.  They're all alike.

        And then it happened... a door opened to a world... rushing through
the phone line like heroin through an addict's veins, an electronic pulse is
sent out, a refuge from the day-to-day incompetencies is sought... a board is
found.
        "This is it... this is where I belong..."
        I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to
them, may never hear from them again... I know you all...
        Damn kid.  Tying up the phone line again.  They're all alike...

        You bet your ass we're all alike... we've been spoon-fed baby food at
school when we hungered for steak... the bits of meat that you did let slip
through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We'v  e been dominated by sadists, or
ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us will-
ing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert.

        This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

        Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me
for.

        I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.  You may stop this individual,
but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

<p>Kosmos
By Walt Whitman
1891</p>
<p>Who includes diversity and is Nature,
Who is the amplitude of the earth, and the coarseness and sexuality of the earth, and the great charity of the earth and the equilibrium also,
Who has not look’d forth from the windows the eyes for nothing, or whose brain held audience with messengers for nothing,
Who contains believers and disbelievers, who is the most majestic lover,
Who holds duly his or her triune proportion of realism, spiritualism, and of the æsthetic or intellectual,
Who having consider’d the body finds all its organs and parts good,
Who, out of the theory of the earth and of his or her body understands by subtle analogies all other theories,
The theory of a city, a poem, and of the large politics of these States;
Who believes not only in our globe with its sun and moon, but in other globes with their suns and moons,
Who, constructing the house of himself or herself, not for a day but for all time, sees races, eras, dates, generations,
The past, the future, dwelling there, like space, inseparable together.</p>
