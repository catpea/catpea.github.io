          <div class="card-text post-content p-3">
            <p>I knew bodybuilding was sus, and needed investigation,
the day I heard some flimsy bodybuilder say: “You can’t do what I do.”</p>
<p>I heard that one before when teachers told me I was dumb,
and graded me down for copying homework, that I programmed myself.</p>
<p>The thing that sealed the deal, was some knuckle dragging knuckle head,
pronouncing the words “superior genetics”.</p>
<p>And to add insult to injury, a wise trainer came on,
showed a dumb ass exercise, and said this will fill in your shoulders nicely.</p>
<p>Last time I saw such a parade of fools,
was at the High School faculty lounge.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let me tell you something, when you can’t hear them,
the adults talk about how they don’t feel like grownups.</p>
<p>And they are right, aging just makes a person look older,
it has negligible impact on their wisdom and greatness.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, it begun, the day I was told my accent was too heavy,
and that the customers could not understand what I was saying.</p>
<p>It turned out, it wasn’t my accent, it is just that the customer was confused,
they didn’t know why FTP was important for their website.</p>
<p>I went home, tired of muppets, who thought and I quote “I didn’t know anything”,
where I was a nice programmer, they just didn’t know what that even was.</p>
<p>I liked smallville, I bought some DVDs and you know the storyline deteriorated,
goodness forbids a work of fiction could inspire.</p>
<p>Lets all just get uneasy, with a crap story line about,
about bad boys and self censored mockingbirds.</p>
<p>(Sorry Ms. Haper, but when you have an opportunity to change the world,
you take that opportunity, and you do not mince words, instead say it like it is)</p>
<p>As the final episode on the last disc I care to purchase,
played the pretty song.</p>
<p>I grabbed my leather jacket and went for a run,
first to a nearby city, and then into the boonies and sticks, letter jacket in hand.</p>
<p>Let me tell you something,
you have never know the magnificent taste of an ice cube.</p>
<p>You need to run until all you can do is crawl,
and then pop an ice cube in your your mouth, what a reward that is.</p>
<p>When I healed up, I gon did it again,
this time, I thought I ruined my feet pretty bad, like 91run bad.</p>
<p>When I stopped my 8 hour 18.7 mile shuffle an unlaced my shoes,
nothing, my feet ticked me, because I was new.</p>
<p>Having stopped, I could barely walk,
I wish I knew to keep on going, I could do a marathon in 12 hours.</p>
<p>Another job started, they told me to use CSS with IE 5,
I showed them pixel perfect cross browser tables, but they didn’t want tables.</p>
<p>Some dumbo, just to sound smart told them the new hire should just use CSS,
to this day, everyone serious uses CSS frameworks for layout.</p>
<p>And I had to change, they sent be back home to put on a suit,
I loved my suit too much, I would never wear it to an office again.</p>
<p>So I quit, over goth pants, that made students from distant lands, apparently,
woinder if I was a Cuban Dancer.</p>
<p>Let me, say this, you change, when someone walks up to you,
and in a normal tone of voice asks you if you are a Cuban Dancer.</p>
<p>It crossed my mind, that it was some kind of a three letter agency handshake,
and I was meant to reply with “The wicker is in the shrubs again”.</p>
<p>But I think it was just Ann Arbor, it si what crap education does to kids,
they live in a strange world and ask strange questions.</p>
<hr>
<p>I loved jogging across the Diag, looking into the library windows,
of a school that I could even dream about affording, not to mention teaching in.</p>
<p>My favorite moment was,
listening to Bryson’s “Short History Of Nearly Everything”...</p>
<p>And having the “#uck not another phylum” part come up somewhere 2AM on state street.</p>
<p>It got me, I laughed so hard at that,
that poor man.</p>
<p>And mind aside, after all the years of trying to jog, my body begun adapting,
I looked at my legs ... and they were muscular.</p>
<p>And that, is how I reinvented bodybuilding,
I thought about how those muscles grew, how fast, what they needed.</p>
<p>I thought about speed, weight, rhythm, focus, music,
wrist weights, weight vest, leg weights, and dumbbells.</p>
<p>And begun jogging to a gym, where I would jog with their equipment,
I gave my self superman shoulders.</p>
<p>Switched gym few times as I became poorer an poorer,
and finally ended up working on my shoulders at the gym I am at.</p>
<p>And then, and I kid you not, some teenage girl,
walked right in front of me, and ignoring me completely…</p>
<p>As if I was a fat balloon,
did a yoga pose.</p>
<p>The worse possible kind of yoga pose, and I hopped out of the so quick,
that she’s probably giggling about it to this day.</p>
<p>&quot;This is my spot now&quot;,
eweweweewee. &quot;Ok, just don&#39;t tell your dad I was working out here.&quot;</p>
<p>It was really weird, could have been a bet,
thou I admit, I was just an invisible fat guy back then.</p>
<p>If I remained there for another billionth of a second until my eyes focused,
the camera would have captured it and I would be paraded out of the gym.</p>
<p>And then her brother would come out of nowhere,
and scare the crabapples out of me.</p>
<p>By which point,
I&#39;d probably agree it was all my fault.</p>
<p>On second thought, as I am somewhat of a deadpan expert my self,
that was probably that young lady&#39;s comedy  stick.</p>
<p>And watching me fly out of that room like a bat out of hell
made her day - thanks as lot, litte lady, jeez.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, I switched to a more portable and flexible method,
because of some rebellious teenager, who stopped giving a crap.</p>
<p>And that is how I ended with dumbbells,
which turned out not to be dumb at all.</p>
<p>I have been dancing with them for ages,
but all it is is just jogging with my upper body.</p>
<p>Instead of pushing my full weight with my legs,
I push as much weight as I can for three hours nearly nonstop with my arms.</p>
<p>And since my arms are connected to the rest of my body,
and dancing demands twisting and turning.</p>
<p>Not only my shoulders, but my mid section and legs,
get a workout too.</p>
<p>It may not seem like it,
but dancing with dumbbells is a full body workout.</p>
<p>Eventually, as the dumbbells get heavier,
they even begin building your chest – full body workout – I kid you not.</p>
<p>I’ll be adding a fourth hour to my workout,
this winter.</p>
