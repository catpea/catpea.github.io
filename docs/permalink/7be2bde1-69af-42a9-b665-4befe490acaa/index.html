            <p>We are each a unique creature,</p>
<p>so what I felt won&#39;t be what you will feel when you are there.</p>
<p>But there are some things</p>
<p>that may be similar.</p>
<p>There are more than 218 moons in our solar system,</p>
<p>each one is an edge, just like the beach at Nordhouse is an edge.</p>
<p>It is really,</p>
<p>just about the same place, gravity doesn&#39;t matter much since you are elated anyway.</p>
<p>You are royalty,</p>
<p>out on your very own Moon.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is important that you have paper an pen,</p>
<p>make sure your notes resist getting wet, test it, things can get wet out there.</p>
<p>The journal, is for a single compound sentence type things,</p>
<p>it is good to write it down.</p>
<p>Though you can&#39;t possibly forget it,</p>
<p>but if you did, the thought would come back to you.</p>
<p>The journal is so that you can scribble a big thought,</p>
<p>and move on to the bigger one.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some example observations maybe...</p>
<p>&quot;Schools are not teaching, tests aren&#39;t testing knowledge,</p>
<p>diplomas are bunk, colleges are a business, and the whole thing is a scam.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uneducated voters are easily swayed by all the things that uneducated,</p>
<p>have always showed to be passionate about, racism, nationalism, hate, and us vs. them logic.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Military targets young boys, because it is easy, because they are easily impressed,</p>
<p>they don&#39;t know enough about the world nor will they know war until it is too late;</p>
<p>fathers are sending their children to kill each other in wars about thing that they ruined.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The Thirteenth Amendment of United States, may force those who participate in Jury Duty,</p>
<p>into participating in slavery, as a slaver.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Criminal who are fractured by the bony hands of poverty,</p>
<p>are not themselves, they are they are victimized by poverty and the denial of even the most basic human rights.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The unforgivable by the desperate act of bankruptcy, College Debt,</p>
<p>alters the meaning of money, a meaning already eroded by the worst of human ideas,</p>
<p>unforgivable debt makes what is owed void, and invalid, it is just a sick version of money that isn&#39;t real.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Government paying colleges for student debt, to save the students from it, is a temporary fix;</p>
<p>asking why colleges charge so much money, is not even the right question,</p>
<p>&quot;Do colleges teach?&quot;, is the correct question.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Poverty and Lack of Education, has brought progress down to a stop,</p>
<p>countries that fought for freedom with great vision,</p>
<p>are falling back down for lack of it,</p>
<p>that vision can only be found in real education, in real wisdom that opens gateways to greatness.&quot;</p>
<hr>
<p>These observations never end... some of them are a little crooked,</p>
<p>you may not have a full picture.</p>
<p>But once you make the observation,</p>
<p>you will become sensitive to all the subjects that stand in support of it.</p>
<p>You won&#39;t make wrong observations,</p>
<p>just ones that need more information.</p>
<hr>
<p>If there is something that is really calling to you,</p>
<p>like Philosophy called to me.</p>
<p>Then just get 15 audio books about it,</p>
<p>sometimes books that don&#39;t come out well as audio books, are just not that good.</p>
<p>Audio books,</p>
<p>may just mark the elite of books worth investing time it,</p>
<p>Einstein said,</p>
<p>&quot;If you can&#39;t explain it simply, you don&#39;t understand it well enough.&quot;</p>
<p>So if a book doesn&#39;t explain something valuable and magnificent, simply,</p>
<p>it probably relates to another quote which goes:</p>
<p>&quot;There&#39;s a sucker born every minute&quot;</p>
<p>So just keep an eye out for the fake charts,</p>
<p>designed to sell garbage meant to pray on uneducated readers,</p>
<p>Or charts that that see nothing wrong when the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Politicians+Buy+Their+Own+Books">pseudo-authors buy their own books with campaign money</a>,</p>
<p>and then use the profits from book sales to launder the money further.</p>
<p>The beautiful thing about real books,</p>
<p>is that they help you figure out who the world&#39;s true leaders are.</p>
<p>They often greatly admire each other,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DKhc1pcDFM">so once you find one</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J4QPz52Sfo">there will be a bunch more</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can see what happens,</p>
<p>out on the edge.</p>
<p>You pull yourself out by your own bootstraps,</p>
<p>from all the noise and chaos that you accepted because you were too young to question it.</p>
<p>I still remember the teacher saying &quot;You need to learn math because you won&#39;t always have a calculator on hand&quot;,</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/catpea/math-as-code">but what I was saying was: you need a computer to learn math for real</a>.</p>
<p>Because I could see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDZ26vj4vFM">there was real fun to be had with mathematics it truly is a beautiful invention</a>,</p>
<p>but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YokKp3pwVFc">teaching formulas without explanation is destroys that beauty, math teachers in their madness are destroying the beauty of mathematics</a>.</p>
<p>One of the anchors that helps me remember problems in middle school,</p>
<p>is being accused of cheating on homework, the teacher gave me a bad grade for an impressive (if I may) program I wrote my self.</p>
<p>This made my bullies laugh at me, of course,</p>
<p>they saw me pacing up and down the enormous corridors writing that program on a piece of paper for days.</p>
<p>In some cases,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxyKNMrhEvY">school can easily destroy us</a>.</p>
<p>The damage caused by fantasy education of nonsense-lecture-and-brainless-test is unspeakable,</p>
<p>pretty much everything broken right now, is because the schools are broken.</p>
<p>I write this in 2021 as the vaccines are just about to become accessible,</p>
<p>the vaccine hesitancy problem that is about to be reveled is a perfect example of the damage fake education has caused.</p>
<p>Just to make it more personal, after the masks are no longer going to be required, you will see husbands bringing the virus home,</p>
<p>and making their family sick, because their level of education trickles them into thinking the &quot;vaccines has problems&quot;, or to quote another case &quot;vaccines have chemicals&quot;.</p>
<p>The gravity of the damage, can bring down entire nations,</p>
<p>without anybody noticing what has gone wrong and where; they will still talk about paying off college debt and giving more money to the teachers.</p>
<p>Nobody in politics will notice, or believe, that schools have caused this,</p>
<p>because it is too complicated for their context, outside of their field of whatever.</p>
<p>More than the middle school, or calculator nonsense, our parents are doing something similar where it comes to College and Career,</p>
<p>the correct path is Real Education and Entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>College and Career are so popular, and there is so much money in this,</p>
<p>that there was never a chance that this could withstand corruption.</p>
<p>Getting fired should not be a threat,</p>
<p>getting replaced by younger, or just more cunning employees should not be a threat in your life.</p>
<p>You need a better plan than College and Career,</p>
<p>and a life where you can live in balance, and with a solid grasp on reality.</p>
<hr>
<p>By this time,</p>
<p>you&#39;ll have a fire going, you don&#39;t always have to go to the beach to watch the sunset.</p>
<p>You maybe, sharpening a stick,</p>
<p>a sausage can be a pretty tasty treat after a day of going up and down dunes in search of some mysterious lost lake, or leg of trail, or just following a goose.</p>
<p>See, your thoughts no longer flow from the middle out,</p>
<p>they now come from the edge, they get under the things.</p>
<p>you don&#39;t just look at what is before you,</p>
<p>but that the many hings that connect to it, that may dictate the future ahead of you.</p>
<hr>
<p>It if feels like you are a Castaway,</p>
<p>it is only because Humans are not meant to be alone, we are tribal creatures.</p>
<p>Your Audio Books, will connect you with the others,</p>
<p>and you will know deep down that they are important enough to override that curse of the cast away, your soul needs Philosophy and Wisdom.</p>
<p>Since it is a small wilderness, or later on a popular trail like the AT,</p>
<p>you won&#39;t feel like a Castaway for long, your Audio Books will be connecting you to all the world&#39;s true leaders, it won&#39;t feel lonely.</p>
<p>But, if you have friends,</p>
<p>bring them along.</p>
<hr>
<p>It rained pretty bad once, and then a thunderstorm came,</p>
<p>this is exactly what you should expect to find, out on the edge.</p>
<p>You are now part of the universe,</p>
<p>might as well be camping on a distant moon.</p>
<p>Make sure that flash floods won&#39;t wash away any of your gear,</p>
<p>and find a spot where it is safe when a great storm comes.</p>
<p>Check for trees that are about to fall, and keep away from those,</p>
<p>if you can&#39;t find a good spot, then know of a safe spot where you can move on a rainy day.</p>
<p>A great storm, is terrifying,</p>
<p>but it is also a great honor.</p>
<p>Every other Adventurer and Creature of Renaissance before you,</p>
<p>had to endure storms just as big, plan ahead, enjoy the fragrance of the woods.</p>
<p>I curled up in my sleeping bag,</p>
<p>put on my headphones and started playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGK84Poeynk">We Are All Connected</a>.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t wait for the storm to pass,</p>
<p>the headphones were enough to dull the thunder.</p>
<p>I fell asleep to the storm,</p>
<p>it wasn&#39;t that uncomfortable.</p>
<p>In the morning everything seemed greener,</p>
<p>I think there were deer by the lake.</p>
<p>It was chilly, but just as soon as the sun comes out from behind the ancient dune, things will warm up,</p>
<p>and you can take a walk to a sunny spot.</p>
<hr>
<p>One time I saw a storm on the horizon,</p>
<p>it looked beautiful, but I got scared, it didn&#39;t even occur to me that it was probably too far, there were no clouds overhead.</p>
<p>My plan was to back up and run for the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/uyJTDb7TLimJfqiLA">trail end</a>, which I did and I just slept there in my little tent,</p>
<p>even though the storm did not come.</p>
<p>I was sure it would, because I think, I am pretty sure, maybe, the grass had a very faint bluish outline,</p>
<p>which seemed to me like static electricity and a sign of trouble.</p>
<p>It looked very beautiful,</p>
<p>it looked very magical.</p>
<p>But with a storm flashing out on the horizon,</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t taking any chances, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/6VbSgS27hpvCvHMV8">I was right by the lake</a>, on top of a little dune with a larger camping spot right behind it.</p>
<p>If I was lightening,</p>
<p>that was the spot I would hit first, so. I. moved.</p>
<p>In the morning I had the pleasure of looking for a new spot,</p>
<p>and I found one, that reminded me of a top of a volcano.</p>
<p>I spent many days there daydreaming, and listening to books,</p>
<p>I had a paper copy of Robinson Cruse and I lazily read that too.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t really pack up and drive away,</p>
<p>I went to the other parking site on Forest Trail, I slept at the State Park again.</p>
<p>I only packed up to leave,</p>
<p>when leaving was all that was left.</p>
