            <p>If you don’t want to replace the agitator,
and do things the expensive way, read on.</p>
<p>Which includes waiting for appointments that give a range,
from 6AM to 11PM, forcing you to take an entire day off to pamper a fraudulent repair man.</p>
<p>Or buing another washer, from a salesman that knows they only last a year or two,
who gets sick pleasure from watching people crawl back in questionably-clean clothes.</p>
<p>Then this text is for you,
but this is not the correct way to fix your washer.</p>
<p>It is a way to fix it wrong,
that may eat a sock or two evey few years.</p>
<p>However, while you should use your best judgement,
this gets stuff working again for just about $6 bucks.</p>
<hr>
<p>The short version, is that your agitator is made of plastic,
to protect your clothes, and becasue it is cheap.</p>
<p>But the rod uponwhich the agitator is affixed,
is metal, so it is metal against plastic, and plastic wears.</p>
<p>It will be either replacing agitator dogs,
or using strong two part epoxy to glue the base.</p>
<p>For full advice, search your favorite video website for repair videos,
please lookup &quot;a washer diagram&quot; on the internet first to learn component names.</p>
<p>You will learn better visually,
from other repair videos.</p>
<p>My main contribution to your repair,
is letting you know that internet is full of repair videos.</p>
<p>What follows is just a long meandering story,
with a few anectodes a long the way.</p>
<hr>
<p>My apartment has seen three washers now,
the original handsome brown 1980 model.</p>
<p>A new one that lasted only a few years,
before the agitator columnn stop spinning.</p>
<p>And the current one,
which broke just this week.</p>
<p>And it was the agitator again,
I own a top loading model.</p>
<p>Where the agitator,
extends full length of the drum.</p>
<p>It is a good idea, the clothes not only rotate back and forth,
but also up and down.</p>
<p>The agitator is full lentgh of the drum,
because it is two agitators.</p>
<p>The base, that rotates left and right.
and the upper screw that pulls clothes up.</p>
<p>Making them travel up and away to the side wall,
and around.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even so, no one should need to by a washer every few years,
so I decided to investigate what the hell is going on.</p>
<p>I unnecessarily looked under the washer first,
I tested that the belt seemed OK and that there was no plastic residue from gears.</p>
<p>Plastic residue on the bottom,
maybe a big problem.</p>
<p>As that my mean the plastic gears sheered off,
though I had seen video, where a person was still gluing them.</p>
<p>Look up part names in a diagram and search around,
it may not be as bad as it seems.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you do have a top loading full column agitator,
there are two problem that can happen.</p>
<p>As the agitator comes in two parts.
The base, which should spin but not freely.</p>
<p>This means when you spin the base,
you should feel that you are turning the motor beneath.</p>
<p>If it feels flimsy, than that means,
your washer agitator is not spinning…</p>
<p>Because it is no longer attached to the motor,
the connection between the motor rod coming up from the bottom.</p>
<p>And the plastic base that agitates water,
sheered off, likely due to overloading your washer.</p>
<p>So the motor shaft tried spinning,
but the clothes prevented it from moving.</p>
<p>And the connection between iron shaft,
and plastic base, failed.</p>
<p>There are some matching grooves there,
in plastic and the metal shaft.</p>
<p>But when the motor jerks to agitate the water,
and the plastic cant move.</p>
<p>Then the plastic grooves will get erased,
by the metal, it is like drilling in plastic – it stands no chance.</p>
<hr>
<p>The top can fail too, the top is seated on the base,
and it looks like a ship screw.</p>
<p>It pulls up clothes surrounding the agitator up,
so that your undies aren’t just stuck in the center of the wacher.</p>
<p>But move to the top,
and sink to the bottom.</p>
<p>So the agitator causes two dimensional motion,
back and forth circular motion, and vertical from down to up and to the side.</p>
<p>But, you don’t want to have a ship screw,
trying to proper your favorite silk shirts.</p>
<p>So it comes with a stupid trick trick,
the top only moves in one direction.</p>
<p>The top screw can only move forward,
and never backward.</p>
<p>As a programmer, this is stupid,
because it involves a super flimsy extra gear.</p>
<p>It introduces a point of failure,
in a critical part of the system hammered by evey wash cycle.</p>
<p>The gear accomplished one way rotation,
by flimsy almost rubbery four plastic parts, called agitator dogs.</p>
<p>If your washer, during a cycle, can’t gently put something up,
with the top of the column, the ship propeller.</p>
<p>It will destroy the rubbery agitator dogs,
the gear will fail to prevent clockwise motion.</p>
<p>The top part will move freely left and right,
the dogs will not come out to engage the arresting gear.</p>
<p>That means as your base, and the central motor-connected rod,
move clockwise.</p>
<p>The top agitator propeller will not move along,
it will just sit there, it will not pull up and around your clothes.</p>
<p>The bottom agitator will move things around back and forth,
but the top agitator will just sit there.</p>
<hr>
<p>It maybe broken right now,
how would you know? Your clothes will still come-out fresh-ish.</p>
<p>So if you have a top loading model with a full column,
rising from bottom of the drum to top.</p>
<p>Gently grab the top agitator by the ship screw,
and see if it rotates both ways.</p>
<p>The top cup where you add fabric softener,
that is just a flimsy litter cover, that will rotate, grab the ears of the ship screw.</p>
<p>If it does, the agitator dogs are broken,
and your clothes do not do not get pulled up and to the side.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is a little known fact, that they are called agitator dogs,
not because they are part of the upper agitator.</p>
<p>But because they have been designed to agitate you,
because now you have to spend four bucks on four pieces of plastic.</p>
<p>And begin repair,
I am agitated just writing about this.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, repair, I cant help you with the bottom of the washer,
but I can help you fix the top.</p>
<hr>
<p>Lets start with the bottom, is it moving freely,
or do you feel like you are moving the motor.</p>
<p>Is there some flimsiness to it?
If so, then you should consider it broken.</p>
<p>The bottom agitator must work hard at sloshing water,
back and forth, if it is flimsy, it is not performing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now lets move to the top,
if it moves both ways when you grab it by the screw.</p>
<p>Get agitator dogs, and go watch videos,
about replacing them.</p>
<p>If you base is moving the motor,
replacing dogs will take 3 minutes.</p>
<hr>
<p>Pull up the fabric softener cup,
there is a seal with an o-ring, pull that up with a tool.</p>
<p>And what you will see is the damn dog gear,
you maybe able to see plastic bits around the soap gunk that got in there.</p>
<p>And that is your problem,
unscrew the screw at the center.</p>
<p>Easier said than done,
if your bottom agitator is broken and moves freely.</p>
<p>Because, you have no way to grab the shaft,
so trying to unscrew the huge screw, will rotate the motor.</p>
<p>But try to tip the drum, try tipping the bottom agitator,
to make that failed plastic engage one last time.</p>
<p>And please, use your f-word, traditionally, wearing low-rise pants,
that expose your rear shall we say CRACK! a tiny little bit also seems to help.</p>
<p>Tipping things to the side and cursing,
will help you.</p>
<p>Once you remove the screw, if your base is broken.
plug the screw hole with a long easy to remove roll of paper.</p>
<p>You do not want epoxy getting into the screw hole,
epoxy will weld that hole shut, and you will never remove the screw again.</p>
<p>Now pull up the weird and flimsy gear,
and it is so flimsy, it will just fall apart.</p>
<p>The bottom part, that is supposed hold agitator dogs.
can just fall off, making the stupid dogs scatter. it is a crappy friction fit.</p>
<p>If your base is solid, put in the new dogs,
again use your f-word, please - including before you start assembly.</p>
<p>Maybe use a tiny-tiny bit of tissue to improve the friction fit,
that holds the dogs together, to prevent it from falling.</p>
<p>And if your base is not flimsy, and turns the motor,
rather that just moving freely, no matter how litte.</p>
<p>Gently insert the stupid dog gear,
and test to see if the ship screw now turns in one direction only.</p>
<p>You are done, screw the screw, but not too hard,
the top agitator must move freely, in one direction.</p>
<p>Put in the o-ring,
and replace the cup.</p>
<p>Call your friends,
asking them about the agitator dogs.</p>
<hr>
<p>If it is the bo ttom, if it moves freely in a flimsy way,
you will have to pull the entire column up.</p>
<p>Take the top off the agitator
lean into the drum and pull up the bottom.</p>
<p>You will see plastic debris on the shaft,
use a brush to clean it off.</p>
<p>Clean the inside of the bottom agitator,
best you can, the roughens of the damaged plastic, will help the epoxy.</p>
<p>And you will need epoxy with the highest PSI,
it should cost about $6 dollars.</p>
<p>The stuff is toxic, don’t breathe it in, use a fan,
mix it up, apply it to the degrease shaft.</p>
<p>You probably don’t need to add it inside the agitator base,
despite damage it is a tight fit, so epoxy will squeeze out either way.</p>
<p>Make sure to protect that screw hole,
and slowly put the base on the shaft.</p>
<p>Watch your eyes, the epoxy will squeeze out,
clean the top of the plastic, whatever squeezed out around the paper in the hole.</p>
<p>And wait for the epoxy to cure,
that base will now be permanently attached to the metal shaft.</p>
<p>You were supposed to replace it,
or call a repair man.</p>
<p>But, that is the con, they want you to do that,
so now you have a permanent epoxy bond.</p>
<p>You will never remove that base,
ever.</p>
<p>Remember, to keep that,
screw hole clean.</p>
<p>If epoxy gets in there,
you shouldn&#39;t wait for the epoxy to cure.</p>
<p>If you do, you will never be able to put the screw in,
as the epoxy will get into the screw thread.</p>
<p>I told you to put a roll of paper in there,
but no, who does that? Whatever… lol.</p>
<p>With the epoxy in the screw hole,
you need a way to clean it, or just put everything together.</p>
<p>In the future, you will never be able to replace those dogs,
if you epoxy the screw in place.</p>
<p>Be careful not to get epoxy into the screw hole,
but if you do, and you don’t wan to to mess with it.</p>
<p>You will now take bad repair with epoxy,
to a new level, when your dogs go bad.</p>
<p>You will need to weld that with epoxy too,
meaning that the top column will not just move one way.</p>
<p>But rotate,
just the same way as the base.</p>
<p>It won’t tear up your clothes,
but if stuff gets stuck the bottom of the washer, will break next.</p>
<p>There are probably plastic gears in there,
and those may not be an easy fix, though I’ve seen it done.</p>
<hr>
<p>Bottom line is this, you pay for your washer,
it should work for ages.</p>
<p>But today’s washers fail after a couple of years,
you can either keep calling the repair person, or get a new one.</p>
<p>Or just weld the plastic parts shut,
it is bad repair, the plastic is meant to fail at a certain point.</p>
<p>It has been tested, and a reasonable company,
that cares for details will see that as a safety mechanism.</p>
<p>If you get something stuck in there,
you rip the bottom agitator or dogs, and need to call for repair.</p>
<p>The right way to control something being stuck,
is in the software, in the micro controller that controls the cycle.</p>
<p>Cheap washers, under some popular brand name,
just destroy the agitator, and expect you to pay.</p>
<p>It will be a lot more than $7 for epoxy,
and they will just replace the plastic.</p>
<p>They will not upgrade the micro-controller,
to sense stress on the motor and wisely stop the cycle.</p>
<p>Letting you remove the stuck clothes,
and protecting the agitator assembly.</p>
<p>Using epoxy, is bad repair,
but you’ve been tricked into paying for an inferior product.</p>
<hr>
<p>How many times will you replace the agitator,
how many washers are you going to buy?</p>
<p>Because that is the number, where you finally snap,
and spend seven bucks on bad ass epoxy that welds the con game shut.</p>
<p>Interestingly turning your washer drum into a thunder-dome,
where two socks enter, and sometimes just one sock leaves.</p>
