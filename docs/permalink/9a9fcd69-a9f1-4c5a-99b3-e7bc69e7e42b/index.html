            <p>I recently quoted a new programmer stating,
“coding is basically just ifs and for loops.”.</p>
<p>And that is true, it is also functions,
which is kind of the base reality of programming.</p>
<p>But, you can add stuff beyond that,
let me show you how that works.</p>
<hr>
<p>All programming languages, are caculators,
where you can say <code>const result = 1+1;</code></p>
<p>And result variable will hold the value of 2,
to display the contents of result, like in a calculator…</p>
<p>You have to say:
print result.</p>
<p>A variable is just a way of saving things,
a variable stores variable content.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am sorry to say that different languages,
have different ways of printing things, and print to different things.</p>
<p>If you wanted to print something to a debug console,
that you can open in a web browser with SHIFT+CTRIL+I.</p>
<p>You would say console.log(result); ENTER,
or you can just say console.log(1+1) and that will print 2 as well.</p>
<p>Now if you wanted to print to the web page that is currently open,
you would say document.body.textContent = 1+1 (which would just show number 2 in the entire window)</p>
<p>So there is no one way printing things,
it depends on context.</p>
<hr>
<p>Everything in programming is like that,
it is about what are you trying to do?</p>
<p>If we wanted to create a calculator with a print function,
that prints to the web page.</p>
<p>We would simply say:
function print(input){document.body.textContent = input}</p>
<p>And we could print numbers,
all day;</p>
<hr>
<p>So in the beginning we can add,
but to do anything beyond that, we need functions.</p>
<p>And I say, if you don’t have one,
the first thing you should away do is to create a print function.</p>
<p>Where it will be printing,
depends on what you are doing.</p>
<hr>
<p>Functions,
abstract and automate.</p>
<p>We have more than just numbers in a programming language,
we also have groups, never use the word group.</p>
<p>No one calls it that,
but for us the normal people arrays, strings, and objects are just groups.</p>
<p>Arrays are a way to hold multiple things under one name,
strings are pretty much arrays of letters.</p>
<p>Languages use a lot of good ideas, to be useful,
so it is best to think of strings as being for text, and having little to do with arrays.</p>
<p>So we are moving up the abstraction ladder,
from numbers, to lists of numbers, and now strings.</p>
<p>By extension, we can now have lists of strings, numbers, functions,
and finally, there is one more grouping thing, called an object.</p>
<p>Objects are not lists,
object name things, rather than keep them in a sequence.</p>
<p>So you can say someObject.someName = “Alice”,
or myCalculator.result = 1+1;</p>
<p>You can get stuff out of a list by number,
it is called an index number.</p>
<p>But it is better to use objects,
and then retrieve things by name.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here, we finally arrive at “coding is basically just ifs and for loops.”,
so we covered the stuff that this quote glosses over.</p>
<p>Calculations, variables to remember them, functions to simplify stuff,
arrays to hold sequential lists of variables, strings to hold text.</p>
<p>And objects, to group things,
under some name.</p>
<p>And by thing I mean, everything we learned so far,
variables, functions, arrays, strings, other objects, arrays of objects, and functions, and more.</p>
<p>So you see, how we are enhancing out abilities,
we started with 1+1, but now have lists of objects that can have objects with names of maybe lists of other stuff.</p>
<p>When we say result = 1+1;
we execute a statement, in time, or in a sequence;</p>
<p>This is where ifs come in,
we can now say if(result &gt; 0){
    print(result)
}else{
    print(“ERROR: Something has ran afoul”);
}</p>
<p>And you bet your fanny,
you can nest if statements.</p>
<p>So now we explode, in multiple directions in a program,
depending on some variable, some parts of you program, many never run.</p>
<p>See, you are now controlling a machine,
you are a wizard.</p>
<p>But there is one more thing we need to upgrade our ability,
because arrays are no good if you just refer to items inside them by number.</p>
<p>Arrays then are just objects,
with stupid names, like 0, 1, 2, 3.</p>
<p>So we need those loops,
a for loop is just one of many kinds of loops, it is the most verbose and flexible.</p>
<p>With loops we can say for every person object in the array of people,
execute some ifs and functions.</p>
<p>This is the base layer of programming,
you can make solid programs here.</p>
<p>The longer you stay on this level of abstraction,
the more of a code poet you become.</p>
<p>You invent state machines, strange chat-bots like ELIZA,
multi-user dungeons, and just thrive in the world of text.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is much more to it,
but it is harder to explain, as you have to use strange new words.</p>
<p>For example, objects are more than ways of grouping named variables,
though this is an important explanation of objects.</p>
<p>Objects model things with properties,
and since they can nest other objects.</p>
<p>They can model the world,
or processes, they abstract things.</p>
<p>An object has two modes of existence,
as a description of something, a specification of it.</p>
<p>And as an instance,
once it has been instantiated with the “new” keyword.</p>
<p>And the reason why you want instances,
is to have multiple instances of the same objects.</p>
<p>An instance of a calculator that writes to the web page,
and an instance of a calculator that writes to the developer console.</p>
<p>Now you can add stuff,
and print it in multiple places.</p>
<p>A more sane example of multiple instances,
is a File object that groups file related operations.</p>
<p>You can have multiple files represented,
by the same File object, by just instantiating the File object with a different path.</p>
<p>Files, are a very primitive concept,
you have to keep track of file handles, and modes, like read or write, or append.</p>
<p>They are a great candidate for being abstracted,
with an Object that has useful funcions.</p>
<p>My favorite abstraction of a File,
is the now <a href="https://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/filesystem/File.html">ancient ActionScript File Object</a>.</p>
<p>Every file you opened had a .desktopDirectory property,
it seems like overkill, and pretty strange.</p>
<p>But that would change based on what operating system you used,
and it was right there in the file object, you didn’t have to ask anything else.</p>
<hr>
<p>And I think the finest example of Object use,
is Component Based User Interfaces.</p>
<p>That just means you are creating a world of Objects,
such as Window, Button, and even Draggable and Selectable.</p>
<p>And you can say, myProgram = new Window();
const calculate = new Button()
myProgram.add(calculate)
and calculate.onClick = funcion(){print(1+1)};</p>
<p>So you see how you have an .add function,
where you can add a button to a Window.</p>
<p>That is all you need, to build massive user interfaces,
with menus, panes, tabs, slide out consoles, and embedded browsers.</p>
<p>Window add menu,
for every menuItem in list of menu items menu add menuItem.</p>
<p>I think web design greatly benefits,
from this type of abstraction, but I seem to be in the minority.</p>
<p>I personally see <a href="https://dojo.io/">new Dojo</a> as being superior to React and now the Ru[i]ned Svelte,
tidy Object based component architectures are just more friendly.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, that we have covered ifs and loops,
and tasted the strange vocabularies with words like instance.</p>
<p>Which at my old job, earned me the nickname “Buzzword Boy”,
and made my idiot co-workers create a web age with my really fat face on it.</p>
<p>And just recently had me ban a user,
who lost his tits assuming I am just speaking in tongues, still too scary to be funnny.</p>
<p>Let us finally, get to the adventure part,
and blow some professional programmer minds.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is something crazy you can do with Objects,
and a lot of programmers either don’t understand that yet, or more likely are freaked out by it.</p>
<p>One of the leading programmers said,
that he made JavaScript reactive, but that is only correct in the context of funcions, kind of.</p>
<p>In the broader context that includes JavaScript OOP programming,
there has been this beautiful little thing.</p>
<p>And I’ll demonstrate it, with the X of a User Interface component tree,
where the x is part of the x and y coordinate system.</p>
<p>But at the same time I also want to give you a preview of it,
so that you know this is not just some boring x to be used in geometry calculations.</p>
<p>Beyond object instantiation, you also want to hoist yourself up,
to using .start() and .stop() in your components.</p>
<p>This helps to let your components to for example,
stop listening to the mouse, when you remove the component form a UI.</p>
<p>Every time you say on click do something,
you need to add a mouse listener...</p>
<p>and you better remove it,
when you get rid of that something.</p>
<p>When for example moving to the next step in a form,
you must remove the listeners from the previous user interface.</p>
<p>A stop() is just the reality,
of cool cats working with the mouse.</p>
<p>If you just leave your listens laying around,
the mouse will eventually get ya.</p>
<hr>
<p>That means, your component,
once instantiated is in a stopped mode.</p>
<p>Or more usefully component.started=false,
mode.</p>
<p>Before you start a User Interface component,
it won’t be displaying anything in the browser.</p>
<p>So if you try to make it draggable,
everything will crash, because you didn’t create anything that can be dragged yet.</p>
<p>The component hasn’t started,
yet.</p>
<hr>
<p>By using a getter and a setter,
that divides the act of assigning to an object property.</p>
<p>We can create a cute little system,
that notifies things when the .started property changes.</p>
<p>So you say observe(started, andDosomething),
where andDosomething is a function that will be given the latest value of started.</p>
<p>And this is the cool part, any time you started=true or started=false,
[and]Dosomething will be automatically executed, with that value.</p>
<p>So all you are saying is .started=true,
and all the observers will start dong their stuff, bringing your component to life.</p>
<p>When moving to the next step in a form,
inside your .stop() you just say .started = false…</p>
<p>And whatever is still listening to that,
will know, it is no loner needed and must clean up after it self.</p>
<p>Now let me show you how the x works,
and then you can go get a drink of water.</p>
<p>To move a window all the way to the left,
you just say window.x = 0;</p>
<p>No crazy function calls, no calling refresh(),
ore remain, you just assign a number to the x.</p>
<p>And the window will react,
as the x notifies all of its observers.</p>
<p>By going an extra step beyond start and stop,
and making the properties of an observable.</p>
<p>You almost, almost, almost pretty much, go back,
all the way to the begging of the language, where we just assign 1+1 to result.</p>
<p>Reactive programming, hides almost everything,
and when you consider, that objects are a programmer interface…</p>
<p>That actually make the programming better,
reactive assignments, make programming accessible to novice users.</p>
<p>And the code, so readable, to programmers,
that they won’t ever want to go back to the non reactive world.</p>
<p>The non-reactive world,
won’t let them request operations out of sequence.</p>
<p>They have to wait, until a component produces elements,
that the mouse can then listen to.</p>
<p>In the reactive world,
things just work in sequence, without any strange syntax at all.</p>
