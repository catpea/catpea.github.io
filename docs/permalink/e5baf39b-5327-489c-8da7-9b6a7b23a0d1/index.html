            <p>I got out of the car and pulled out my backpack,
hearing gravel beneath my feet made me happy.</p>
<p>This was my first visit to the Nurnberg Rd. end,
of Nordhouse Dunes, and there were other hikers there.</p>
<p>For one I remember the Lumber Jacks,
or the mess with the best die like the rest club of bearded real men.</p>
<p>And a young lad, with a broken heart,
and movement that bespoke, ain’t my first rodeo.</p>
<p>Everyone suddenly stopped doing what they were doing,
and eyed my cool survival belt.</p>
<p>That I built up, by putting on multiple colorful fanny packs,
with all kinds of cool stuff inside them.</p>
<p>I had a little iPod with a cool poem about growing up,
and though I lost it there, it probably made the finder keeper cry.</p>
<p>I mean it was a really nice audio poem,
one of my fist, and it was about learning, growing up, and celebrating life.</p>
<p>As the pro hikes stopped staring at my cool gear,
I went over to the information board to study it.</p>
<p>I’ve read everything in great detail, about the rules and bears,
and promptly forgot it all.</p>
<p>I could have gotten in trouble, as later on, I took my bike to the trails,
that is a big no-no, thankfully people left me alone.</p>
<p>I discovered brushes for boots o brush off foreign seeds,
as not to introduce any new species to the ecosystem.</p>
<p>And I carefully, cleaned my jogging shoes,
stepping into all the seeds that other hikes left behind with.</p>
<p>While they already begun filling up with ancient dune sand,
as they had little netted windows that created a fun breeze when walking.</p>
<hr>
<p>My fist rule of adventure is to stop at all the antique stores,
no exceptions.</p>
<p>But my second rule, is to find the two sticks needed for survival,
in the bush.</p>
<p>The walking stick, o more accurately, what was once a small tree,
and now can stop both a brown bear and a couple of hillbillies named Cleatus.</p>
<p>And the sausage stick, which is even more important, and harder to find,
as it needs to be both sturdy and pointy, quite the oxymoron in the woods.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was lucky to find them before getting to the big hill,
because back then, it was quite a climb, and I needed to take a break half way.</p>
<p>I had my programming diagrams with me,
so that was rather convenient.</p>
<hr>
<p>I was about a quarter way to the Lake Michigan shore,
when I noticed a white spot far behind the trees.</p>
<p>I walked of the tail and begun making my way through the bush,
thinking it was a dune, that would surely yield the lake.</p>
<p>After five minutes of bush whacking, and collecting all the spiderwebs,
I needed more rest, and I was shocked to discover… a compass, as I was lost.</p>
<p>The bright-spot just turned out to be some well lit leaves in the distance,
and there was nothing there but more trees.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, after I managed to collect all the spider webs in the area,
the bush pooped me out back on the earlier section of the trail.</p>
<p>A Bill Bryson looking man was chugging along the tail,
noticed me come out the side and eyed at my spiderwebs with a curious expression.</p>
<p>“I got lost” – I explained,
he didn’t say a word, thinking that I was dangerously special.</p>
<hr>
<p>There was a couple of forks, and Knowing that Lake Michigan was on the left,
I just tuned left, both times, remembering that old miner rule.</p>
<p>But now after all this time bushwhacking,
I wondered how would that prevent someone from going in a circle.</p>
<p>At which point I came down a tall and narrow passage,
just to be hit by the sunlight.</p>
<p>Not since my birth did I experience such a surprise,
the woods simply ended!</p>
<p>And I was now blinking,
in the middle of a sunny dessert.</p>
<hr>
<p>My third rule of adventure,
is to find a camping site with easy access to firewood.</p>
<p>Every camping spot at Nodhouse is beautiful,
but the one I found had a fallen tree trunk.</p>
<p>That was dragged into an opening,
and used as a group seat.</p>
<p>I clambered up the dune,
and plopped on it, upon a quick check for bugs.</p>
<p>I took out my saw, and started mindlessly sawing a jagged chunk,
knowing that I have a week’s worth of firewood under my butt.</p>
<p>Moments later,
I had my tents up</p>
<p>Anti-mosquito stick incense smoking like chimneys,
and enough bits of wood in my fire ring for dinner.</p>
<p>I waited for the sunset for a long time,
and it was perfect, you could almost feel the edge of the universe.</p>
<p>I am a man of culture, I bring two tents,
not once, have I ever been filthy in the woods.</p>
<p>But those who don’t like dragging a second tent,
should know that twilight has just enough light, to bring privacy and see trouble coming from far away.</p>
<hr>
<p>I stuck my walking stick into a hole some distance away from camp,
and hung my lantern on it.</p>
<p>The lantern would keep all the active bugs moths, and spiders away,
enchanting them to the bright LED light.</p>
<hr>
<p>With my fire half way though a heavy chunk of a stump,
I begun sharpening my other stick.</p>
<p>You want a nice thin long stretch, just about the length,
of the evening sausage.</p>
<p>I make some cuts in the sausage,
to rid the fat, and let it roast for a goodie long while</p>
<hr>
<p>The stars were out, by the time I finished,
which brings us to the fourth rule of adventure.</p>
<p>Unless you are staying up late,
as I was to take in my first day.</p>
<p>Do not fight the nigh with a flashlight,
not even the fire.</p>
<p>Have your dinner before it gets dark,
and as the light of twilight fades, get ready to sleep.</p>
<p>You fall asleep in the woods, by listening to narrated adventure books,
especially early on when every rustle causes concern.</p>
<p>Aim to wake up when the sun starts coming out,
synchronize with the day and night.</p>
<p>No sunrise should ever go to waste...
at Nordhouse it will be chilly, in the morning.</p>
<p>Animals will come to drink from the lake,
it is quite a sight to behold.</p>
<p>And you will have to climb the dunes,
and search for a break in the trees to get warmed up.</p>
<p>(slow)</p>
<p>It is good time to plan for breakfast,
and find some branches for the breakfast fire.</p>
<p>Afterword</p>
<p>The Bryson look-alike would later cross paths with me,
as I was carrying both my backpacks to the car.</p>
<p>I must have looked as beaded as the lumberjacks,
and as mighty as Conan.</p>
<p>I had my mighty walking stick across my back,
and both my packs (bedroom and bathroom) hung on each end.</p>
<p>And the boy with the shattered heart was back in one piece,
he stayed over a month, and when we crossed paths at a narrow ledge of a dune.</p>
<p>He said, “Dude!”,
to which I replied “Though Shall Pass”.</p>
<p>It turned out that I wasn’t the huge pussy that all assumed I was,
and that the only people who left early - wouldn&#39;t you know it - were the lumberjacks.</p>
<p>Ladies and Germtermen,
go camping, and stay as long as you can.</p>
<p>We area all too good,
at bottling up stress and overworking ourselves into an early grave.</p>
<p>You won’t know how bad you have it,
until after more than two weeks of camping.</p>
