            <p>We are in fact indoctrinated into a series of false beliefs,
think of it as the “cult”, in the term Global Culture.</p>
<p>The likelihood of anybody exiting this cult,
is very low.</p>
<p>Just about the same as the victim of a religious cult,
exiting their belief system.</p>
<p>Those of you who have already figured it out,
will say, a global cult is not really a cult.</p>
<p>But actually, the way we should define a cult in this context,
is believing in falsehoods that make us act against ourselves.</p>
<hr>
<p>Once examined, I would wager that, that the list of our false beliefs, is no larger,
than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions">Wikipedia’s list of Common Misconceptions</a>.</p>
<p>It is likely that our best effort to lift ourselves out of this madness,
would be a narrated book similar in spirit to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudodoxia_Epidemica">Pseudodoxia Epidemica</a>.</p>
<p>If you are going to pen this work,
you need actors, celebrities, stars to narrate your work.</p>
<p>Two volumes that live in the same area and paint a good picture,
of the gravity of this work.</p>
<p>Are the heartbreaking “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=A+People%27s+History+of+the+United+States">A People&#39;s History of the United States</a>”,
by Howard Zinn.</p>
<p>And, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=A+Short+History+of+Nearly+Everything">A Short History of Nearly Everything</a>”,
by Bill Bryson.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can get at the false beliefs yourself,
like a normal person.</p>
<p>Simply find a wrong, and walk it back past the symptoms,
all the way into the root causes.</p>
<p>I will only share stories,
that I personally find important.</p>
<p>Once in passing, I have heard of a young lady, who when she was a child,
cried, when it was explained to her that the beggars on the streets don’t have homes.</p>
<p>A victim of a cult, wouldn’t cry, not think about it much,
if they could help it.</p>
<p>The day she accepted that some people are like that,
she became more indoctrinated into our cult.</p>
<p>Know that addiction, or even crime for that matter, is not a choice,
it is a desperate attempt, to survive another day.</p>
<p>In a world where most people think of you,
as trash, and all you have ever know was abuse and tragedy.</p>
<p>There are very few criminal in this world,
and especially those that brag about their evil, are likely victims of terrible crimes themselves.</p>
<p>Prison, another false belief, that roughly states,
that we should punish those who were already punished into fractured lives.</p>
<p>Is an environment where people who have been warped into doing terrible things,
need to pretend to be evil, so that they survive another day.</p>
<p>The solution, to this set of false beliefs,
is a guarantee of a Safe Home, Free Medical Care and Highest Education, a Trustworthy Universal Income Card…</p>
<p>And ability to move, travel, thrive, learn, bloom, dream, love,
and invent, and create, and innovate, and motivate, and share… to name a few.</p>
<hr>
<p>A culture, where poverty, homelessness, ineffective education,
hunger, religious indoctrination into non-fact based fantasies…</p>
<p>Or indoctrination into cultures of violence, addiction,
or even sacrifice in war is tolerated, is a kind of a cult - and you deserve better than this.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another time, on my morning bicycle run,
while I was climbing a hill, I was stopped, by a large man, who asked.</p>
<p>How are you doing this, this was a wise large man,
he already gave up his car, and the son of a gun was bicycling to work, very courageous.</p>
<p>I told him that his health both mental and physical,
was more important than anything else.</p>
<p>I told him that the i-275 bicycle trail that we were on,
stretched from 14 mile to a pier on lake Erie - and I told him what he needed to do,</p>
<p>But, his propensity for treating his disorder,
with the pleasure of overeating…</p>
<p>At his age… left him with maybe 10 or 20 years max,
in a word, there are no fat old people.</p>
<p>He would pass in his late 40’s or mid 50’s,
you see... and you may see that very well if you go to a gym…</p>
<p>This type of a chance encounter, with a fighter,
is basically a two time event, he was going to give up soon.</p>
<p>It is hell to bicycle to work in rain or snow,
to be treated with disrespect, and a 25 cent raise.</p>
<p>The survives, the mad men, who make it out of obesity,
have to make very drastic changes in their lives.</p>
<p>If he was an honest man who truly loved his wife,
she’d join him.</p>
<p>Dixie, the most recent Philosopher,
I encountered in an internet video.</p>
<p>Said, in one of her Triple Crown videos (where she breathlessly hiked AT, PCT and CDT),
“The worst day on the trail, is still better than the best day at work”.</p>
<p>And wonderhussy once readout a piece of graffiti,
in one of the cabins she was exploring that read:</p>
<p>“Work to live, don’t live to work”</p>
<p>You see I told the large man to quit his job,
because it was killing him.</p>
<p>He smiled and wholeheartedly said,
“I can’t do that”.</p>
<p>He was an outlier back then,
maybe he is a bodybuilder today, large people have enormous muscles to carry that extra weight.</p>
<p>This second story, is about protecting ones family from poverty,
and again it demands that no one faces life on the street, if they quit their job.</p>
<p>Nor should their family end up poor, because they quit their jobs,
sold their home and hit the trails…</p>
<p>And as a result, stayed a family and skinny,
for extra 50 magnificent years.</p>
<hr>
<p>My final story is me asking my grandma bout war, she said,
“It is what men do”.</p>
<p>They were old enough to know WWII,
I don’t know this to be true,</p>
<p>But maybe grandpa told her that being bullied in shool,
helped him survive in war.</p>
<p>I don’t understand why she didn’t help me,
when I told her I was being bullied.</p>
<p>In my mind,
I saw my bullies as the enemy from her war.</p>
<p>Wars don’t just occur to hide economic failures,
they need an uneducated soldiers/</p>
<p>Who are easily tricked to die,
for imaginary god and meaningless borders.</p>
<p>The only people who should fight in war,
are those who declare it, who support it, leave the tens of thousands of vulnerable families alone.</p>
<p>But realistically, war can only be prevented,
and prevention requires, real and effective education.</p>
<p>The people who believe in war, especially the bad side, that is first to cause harm,
are misguided, tricked, manipulated, warped, often desperate and starved.</p>
<p>All of that was to be walked back,
to prevent it.</p>
<p>No human being on this planet,
should ever starve, or live in desperation, or be indoctrinated into a life of some fantasy.</p>
<p>One of our greatest responsibilities,
now made more urgent due to climate change and potential nuclear war.</p>
<p>Is opening borders, unfortunately, this is not just a matter of a passport,
but becoming un-indocrinated from the culture the person of family is leaving behind.</p>
<p>It is not true to say that not all families need it,
changing cultures if left unchecked, will undo a lot of the bonds that holds a family together.</p>
<p>A set of dignified and loving steps,
that transition families between cultures is a very good idea.</p>
<p>To bring someone from a culture of crime,
to a safe and prosperous city, is to ensure tragedy for both the victims and new comer.</p>
<p>Transitioning a person between cultures requires love,
compassion and understanding.</p>
<p>You can’t just drop desperate people from a desperate place,
to another and into desperate circumstances.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Human Right education, must be requires in all schools,
including developed countries as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missoula:_Rape_and_the_Justice_System_in_a_College_Town">Jon Krakauer&#39;s Missoula</a> explains.</p>
<hr>
<p>By far the two biggest false belief the world is suffering from,
is tolerance of infective education, and lack of universal income that erases poverty.</p>
<p>And I am sorry to say, that as far as I can tell,
all the false beliefs that plague the human kind will result in an endless chain of meaningless wars.</p>
<p>The false beliefs are everywhere, but the outcome is one thing, war,
war, is the failure where all the consequences come together.</p>
<p>And between the meaningless and preventable wars,
expect nothing less than blind repetitions of the same old mistakes.</p>
<hr>
<p>We are all meant to grow and grow all the way up,
until we each become a great being.</p>
<p>On our way there,
we will find all the meaning, and fathom more.</p>
