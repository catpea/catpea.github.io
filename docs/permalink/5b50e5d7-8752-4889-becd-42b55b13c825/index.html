            <p><strong>I. The Inheritance</strong></p>
<p>You were handed a broken map
and told it was the only road—
so you handed it down, still torn,
still leading nowhere worth arriving.</p>
<p>You were taught to sit, to comply, to forget
the questions burning in your throat,
and when your children began to ask,
you taught them silence was safer than truth.</p>
<p>This is not your fault alone,
but it became your fault
the moment you stopped asking
whether the inheritance was worth keeping.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>II. The Bargain</strong></p>
<p>You traded their wonder for security,
their fire for a pension,
their &quot;why&quot; for &quot;because I said so,&quot;
their becoming for mere surviving.</p>
<p>You called it love—
this slow flattening,
this gentle suffocation
wrapped in good intentions.</p>
<p>You feared their hunger
because yours was never fed,
and starving people
do not trust abundance.</p>
<p>But your fear is not their fate
unless you make it so.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>III. The Delegation</strong></p>
<p>You gave them to the institution
like offerings to a temple
whose gods you never believed in
but were too tired to question.</p>
<p>Eight hours a day, they sat
learning obedience dressed as knowledge,
conformity dressed as achievement,
silence dressed as respect.</p>
<p>And when they came home empty,
you blamed them for not trying,
never asking what the system
was designed to produce.</p>
<p>It was never designed for greatness.
It was designed for compliance.
And you, weary, let it have them
because the fight seemed too large.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>IV. The Mirror</strong></p>
<p>Look at what you worship:
comfort over meaning,
safety over truth,
approval over integrity.</p>
<p>Your children learned to worship it too.
They learned it from your silences,
from your careful avoidances,
from every time you chose the easy lie.</p>
<p>They learned that adults
do not believe their own words,
that principles are decorations,
that the soul is negotiable.</p>
<p>You taught them this
without saying a word.
Children are scholars
of what we actually do.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>V. The Unlived Life</strong></p>
<p>The dreams you buried
did not stay buried.
They rose up in your children
as the same longing you abandoned.</p>
<p>And when you saw that light in them—
that terrible, beautiful fire—
you reached for water,
calling it wisdom, calling it protection.</p>
<p>But it was fear.
Fear that they might succeed
where you surrendered.
Fear that they might prove
it was possible all along.</p>
<p>So you clipped wings
and called it teaching them to walk.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>VI. The System You Serve</strong></p>
<p>They needed Socrates.
You gave them test prep.</p>
<p>They needed to know why humans suffer
and what makes life worth living.
You gave them grades and rankings
and the terror of falling behind.</p>
<p>They needed to be <em>seen</em>—
their particular genius honored,
their specific struggles met.
You gave them to a machine
that cannot see anything
but average.</p>
<p>And when the machine
returned them broken,
you blamed the child
for not fitting the mold.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>VII. The Conspiracy of Silence</strong></p>
<p>You knew.</p>
<p>You knew the schools were failing.
You knew the tests measured nothing that matters.
You knew the homework was busywork.
You knew the spirit was being crushed.</p>
<p>You knew, and you said nothing,
because everyone else said nothing,
and silence is so much easier
than being the one who speaks.</p>
<p>Your children needed a defender.
They got a collaborator.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>VIII. The Abdication</strong></p>
<p>You were their first teacher,
their first window to the world,
their first evidence
of what humanity could be.</p>
<p>And you outsourced it.</p>
<p>To screens that teach them
they are not enough.
To systems that teach them
they are interchangeable.
To cultures that teach them
consumption is meaning.</p>
<p>You had the sacred task
of forming a soul,
and you treated it
like an inconvenience
to be managed.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>IX. What They Needed</strong></p>
<p>They needed you to fight—
not for their comfort,
but for their becoming.</p>
<p>They needed you to question
every authority that demanded
their submission without earning
their respect.</p>
<p>They needed you to say:
<em>My child is not a product.</em>
<em>My child is not a score.</em>
<em>My child is not raw material
for someone else&#39;s economy.</em></p>
<p>They needed you to be
the adult you wished you&#39;d had—
the one who saw the fire
and fed it.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>X. The Reckoning</strong></p>
<p>Now they sit in rooms
scrolling through emptiness,
wondering why they feel
like strangers to themselves.</p>
<p>Now they have credentials
but no convictions,
information but no wisdom,
opinions but no foundation.</p>
<p>Now they are afraid
to want anything too much,
to believe anything too deeply,
to become anything too fully.</p>
<p>This is the harvest
of seeds you did not know
you were planting.</p>
<p>But you planted them
with every silence,
every surrender,
every well-meaning betrayal.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>XI. The Door That Remains</strong></p>
<p>And yet—</p>
<p>The soul is stubborn.
It does not die easily.
Beneath the rubble of
fake education and distraction,
something still breathes.</p>
<p>Your children still hunger
for what they were denied.
They still dream of lives
that mean something.</p>
<p>The fire you tried to drown
is not dead.
It is waiting.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>XII. The Call</strong></p>
<p>So now, what will you do?</p>
<p>Will you keep serving
the gods that failed you?
Will you keep offering your children
to systems that do not love them?</p>
<p>Or will you become, even now,
even late,
the parent you were meant to be—</p>
<p>The one who says:
<em>I was wrong.</em>
<em>I was afraid.</em>
<em>But I am not afraid anymore.</em></p>
<p>The one who chooses,
finally, to fight
for what matters most.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>XIII. The Truth</strong></p>
<p>You cannot unbuild
what has been built.
But you can stop building
on rotten foundations.</p>
<p>You can stop lying
about what you value.
You can stop pretending
the system serves your children
when it serves only itself.</p>
<p>You can begin, today,
to tell them the truth:</p>
<p><em>The world is broken.
And I helped break it.
But you—
you can be part of healing it.
And I will help you now,
instead of standing in your way.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>XIV. The Covenant</strong></p>
<p>Every child born
is a question the universe asks:
<em>Will you honor this?
Will you serve this becoming?</em></p>
<p>Most of us answer
with cowardice and convenience.
We answer with delegation and distraction.
We answer by looking away.</p>
<p>But the question does not disappear.
It lives in every struggling student,
every over-medicated child,
every young person who has forgotten
how to want.</p>
<p>The question is still being asked.</p>
<p>How will you answer now?</p>
<p>Will you help your children to grow,
so that someday they may grow all they way up,
and become great beings...</p>
