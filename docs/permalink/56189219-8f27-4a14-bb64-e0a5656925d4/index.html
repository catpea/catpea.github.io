            <p>It is easy to figure out what school bullies want,
they wan you to become a snarling beast like they are.</p>
<p>They want to poison you with so much of their hate,
that you will not have a choice but to hate everything yourself.</p>
<hr>
<p>But the Beast and the Barbarian are on the opposite ends,
the latter is a warrior, and the first a mess frothed-up by their shitty fathers.</p>
<p>Who regretted their hookup, the marriage, and the first and the second kid,
and I bet you, like father like son, the bully destroyed his family too.</p>
<p>The hollow never grow up,
there is nothing in them to prevent implosion.</p>
<hr>
<p>I didn’t have many friends,
but I had my science book to ponder.</p>
<p>And shortly thereafter programming,
which apparently now is a kind of an inside-joke.</p>
<p>That bullied kids are drawn to programming,
but, I was drawn to the infinite complexity of it.</p>
<p>I cared not for games,
I wanted to program deep into the computer to see what is there.</p>
<hr>
<p>In sixth or seventh grade,
we had a programming class “Informatyka”.</p>
<p>And some Elwro 800 Junior computers,
Basically a ZX Spectrum.</p>
<p>And the hip teacher accused me of lying, copying code,
having someone help me with it, and graded me down.</p>
<p>My bullies laughed at me, but I wasn&#39;t reacting,
I was proud of my little program.</p>
<p>Like my bullies, my tracers were also unraveling before me,
they were well wishing monstrosities.</p>
<p>Bound on destroying what made us special, and unique,
and they were successful with the rest oof my class.</p>
<p>I remained the black sheep, still to face countless bad grades,
and bullies, who got so dangerous, they had knives.</p>
<p>My main bully lied to them that I was hurting him,
to learn how to control people, I guess.</p>
<p>I just saw a loser,
with perfect grades, all of which were fake.</p>
<hr>
<p>Long ago, in a crafty escape from a speech class,
where you have to give speeches…</p>
<p>A big no-no,
for now, an immigrant in America, missing many words…</p>
<p>Whilst quietly wandering corridors,
I got snagged by a future Principal.</p>
<p>Who wanted to see what misfits were rreally like,
so that he could run a school more effectively.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>I call his classroom, the suicide club,
and I am proud that my adventures took me there.</p>
<p>I call it this way because that is what the teachers saw,
but we were the opposite, we were surrvivers.</p>
<hr>
<p>And yes, every one of us in that room,
had massive superpowers, it was unbelievable.</p>
<p>We got filtered right through the crappy system,
into a single classroom, it is almost comedy.</p>
<p>These were teenage titans,
warriors born to battle.</p>
<hr>
<p>They were much stronger than the European kids,
I grew up around.</p>
<p>And they had American color and beauty,
straight out of those 1990’s High School movies.</p>
<p>And were more intricate in their minds,
I can name every one of their superpowers, to this day.</p>
<hr>
<p>There was one more person, a ghost, a warrior angel,
who, wasn’t in the class, didn’t come acros as needing fixing.</p>
<p>A young lady who tried to befriend me,
I was much to shy and couldn&#39;t really speak english all that well.</p>
<p>But, whoever that was,
is still helping people today, I am sure of it.</p>
<p>That was not an ordinary person,
definitely a warrior, a valkyrie, a guardian, a titan.</p>
<hr>
<p>And now as an adult,
I can tell you what the principal was looking for.</p>
<p>I can explain it in a in a word too,
The misfits were…. unbreakable.</p>
<hr>
<p>They werre causing trouble,
not because they couldn&#39;t adapt.</p>
<p>But because they rejected,
half measures, memorization, shitty parents, bullies, and pretending to fit.</p>
<p>The suicide club was not a class of broken kids,
they were the ones that could not be broken.</p>
<hr>
<p>They were the one who took life seriously,
who lived for real, and saw it as a big deal.</p>
<hr>
<p>One skinny boy, resisted being made fun of,
and wore his favorite shirt with a cute frog.</p>
<p>Ignoring the bullies making fun of him,
complaining to us, how broken their minds were.</p>
<p>The rich girl didn’t put up with anybody crap,
because she was already an adult at 16.</p>
<p>The traveler, slept in a trash can,
and woke up just fine the unbreakable warrior that he was.</p>
<p>The trench coat girl, a survive,
built families out of rejects from the get go, she was what her mother wasn’t</p>
<hr>
<p>Lots of kids had problems in that school,
but they slowly let the school crush them.</p>
<p>The rejects, the misfits, the club,
already lived their real lives.</p>
<hr>
<p>The principal when he was preparing the class,
put up a poster that said “Wherever You Go There You Are”.</p>
<p>Thinking that we were troubled,
but we were the most authentic thing in that school.</p>
<p>He needed to read that poster more than we did,
we already had integrated personalities and eyes on our futures.</p>
<hr>
<p>Unlike the movies, none of us had a normal finale,
we each went separate directions.</p>
<p>I left the same semester,
the biology teacher said weed was an herb, and I dropped out the same day.</p>
<p>I got scooped up by adult ed,
but school was interfering with my education.</p>
<p>I was only able to give proper programming the focus it deserved,
after graduating high school.</p>
<p>And college was even a bigger problem,
I ended up on the Dean’s List.</p>
<p>But I expected higher standards,
for one Philosophy class only taught Descartes.</p>
<p>It is a good start, but Philosophy is so much more,
and the class destroyed the promise it held.</p>
<p>And for me, it took the College,
along wit it.</p>
<p>Like always,
I was better off learning on my own.</p>
<hr>
<p>The misfits,
they were always too over-powered for an ordinary existence.</p>
<p>They are everywhere,
but nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>They are a billion times wiser,
then when we were children.</p>
<p>The history maybe written by the victors,
but it is the misfits that grow all the way up, and change the world.</p>
