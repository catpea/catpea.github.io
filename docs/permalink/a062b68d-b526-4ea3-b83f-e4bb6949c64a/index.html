            <p>This is a common question in the field of ineffective philosophy,
also known as academic philosophy, church of knowledge, and sophistry.</p>
<p>If you have arrived here from a school that uses grades to control you,
under the threat of ridicule, punishment, being held back and ruining your life.</p>
<p>Know that you are a victim of indoctrination, and you will need,
something that some therapists call reprogramming.</p>
<hr>
<p>A real school, will never cut up knowledge into subjects,
or threaten, or punish you, or rob you of you savings, and force you into loans.</p>
<p>In a real school, when you are studying biology,
you become enabled with new capabilities.</p>
<p>For example, for months, of for the rest of your long life,
you end up loving and keeping water-bears as pets.</p>
<p>You have videos of interesting happenings in the microbial world,
and later go on to learn programming to encode strings of text in DNA and such.</p>
<p>In a fake biology class, your teacher will force you to memorize,
that mitochondria is the powerhouse of he cell.</p>
<p>And it will take you couple of decades to realize,
that the curriculum was incomprehensible on purpose.</p>
<p>It was crappily designed to force you to memorize for tests,
because as tests, accreditation, funding and politicians are concerned.</p>
<p>Temporary memorization, is just as good as effective education,
when it comes to selling you out, the world, and everything else.</p>
<p>Later on in your life the words “mitochondria is the powerhouse of he cell”,
will be all that remains of your biology class.</p>
<p>And it will greatly sadden and embarrass you,
how you were betrayed, manipulated, and used.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you are very unlucky, your Biology teacher will be pretty cool,
talk about Dolly the cloned sheep, how dissection of frogs is wrong…</p>
<p>And finally,
how weed is just an herb.</p>
<p>Here is a good example of a freedom of choice point,
because in that moment, you have to get up, with any delay.</p>
<p>See you counselor,
explain the situation, hear the low effort...</p>
<p>And then you walk out, stare the security right in their creepy face,
<a href="http://archive.cantonpl.org/observer/2000/02_Feb%202000/02-06-2000.pdf">to say the least</a>, and go on about your life, without being stained by everybody else’s shit.</p>
<hr>
<p>This is applied freedom of will, an event occurs, that can derail the rest of your life,
and you just leave, with little doubt.</p>
<p>The kids that remain in the Biology class,
are an example of people with their freedom of will subverted by threat.</p>
<p>Some are already unable to quit their drugs,
and are glad to hear that is just an herb, as it helps them to give up.</p>
<p>Others will become responsible dads,
who every one in a while sneak something little extra for their two year old.</p>
<p>So that he can hope rekindle,
his already failed life, where he just went from loser to monster.</p>
<p>Some mothers don’t even care to notice that the kid,
always sleeps through sexy time.</p>
<hr>
<p>Others will of course spend their parents money on college,
maybe a DUI, maybe academic suspension, but almost certainly debts and depression.</p>
<p>Some will end up in trash cans, worried about garbage collection day,
trying to understand their family.</p>
<p>I’ve the honor of meeting a garbage kid once,
addiction was a problem, but he was powerful, and I’d like to believe he became a philosopher.</p>
<hr>
<p>One of the greatest mistakes, that the soon to be principal of my school eve made,
was recruiting me as a control sample, to his suicide club class.</p>
<p>I really hope that this man, became wise enough to see the rejects,
as the most brilliant kids in that school.</p>
<p>Being part of that class, completely restored my faith in humanity,
hampered by bullies, creepers, pretenders and regretters.</p>
<p>It was them who gave me the courage to drop out,
to do the right thing, the honest thing, the life changing thing for me, for me.</p>
<hr>
<p>While my freedom of will,
remained strong among all the doubt.</p>
<p>I lacked the understanding that I needed books, all of them,
and instead, I spoiled my next step.</p>
<p>Instead of fixing education starting in my high school days,
I was threatened into just memorizing for the Adult Education tests.</p>
<p>It was still a high school, and a High School Diploma,
but the students were not treated like cattle.</p>
<p>I suspect the principals always know that they cause harm,
they help those who stick out far enough.</p>
<p>They are arrogant, and ignorant,
but not evil – they just bargain with it.</p>
<hr>
<p>You see, freedom of choice is not a question,
it is an act.</p>
<p>When yo are subjected to ineffective education,
and asked this question, then the teacher pains you as infantile, and him or her self as a fool.</p>
<hr>
<p>Freedom of choice is also very urgent,
a single hesitation, will cost a decade.</p>
<p>While, after I spoiled the high school test, out of fear,
I had the presence of mind, to study programming, I had three somewhat nice jobs as a result.</p>
<p>Again, learning for real means that you have effective education,
a fake education, is just words.</p>
<p>In my frost programming job that lasted less than a minute,
I was asked “Do you know where I can get some weed?”.</p>
<p>That was right after I signed the paperwork,
needles to say, he just threw them away.</p>
<p>In my second job I was told that if I wanted a raise,
I should go to a strip club.</p>
<p>Eventually followed by being told,
that I will never receive one – I quit instantly.</p>
<p>Do not bargain with the flimsy wife,
of a racist cop.</p>
<p>In the third job my correct use of the words “class instance”,
prompted my co workers to call me buzzword boy.</p>
<p>They made a little website with my picture,
where I could not look more fat, even if I tried.</p>
<p>This helped me lose 100 pounds,
and started me on a life long journey toward becoming a shit kicking beefcake.</p>
<p>In my fourth job, I was tasked with destroying cross platform user interface layouts,
in favor of CSS a technology that still isn’t quite yet ready.</p>
<p>It can be done, and it works now,
but not perfectly, even after some 17 years.</p>
<hr>
<p>Fake education can only put you in two work environments,
among losers and uneducated pretenders and hustlers.</p>
<p>Or in an environment so toxic,
that every paycheck will take weeks of life way from you – just to be fired when you are half dead.</p>
<hr>
<p>The question of freedom of will,
consists of two main parts.</p>
<p>One, have you accepted your intellectual inheritance,
as it has been posed by all the great beings that set their legacy in books.</p>
<p>In other words, you must be able to push stress away,
probably by means of adventure, where stress an toxicity can’t get you.</p>
<p>And begin consuming narrated book, you are very lucky,
to be living theis day and age.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9n1F1JupY8&amp;pp=ygUQQVQsIFBDVCwgYW5kIENEVA%3D%3D">You get to walk through the woods and beaches, and listen to great beings</a>,
helping you inherit their greatest intellectual achievements.</p>
<p>Please, never sleep in trash cans, and never go on the trail alone,
rather than dropping out you have to begin working on a self directed visualization based alternative to high school.</p>
<p>And the second, more frightening part,
you have to contemplate your indoctrination.</p>
<p>It has been said are genetically predisposed to listen to our elders,
the kids who do not heed the warning about snakes, or bears, do not pass their genes forward.</p>
<p>And your indoctrination, is again – almost – by definition, fantasy based,
it purely depends on to whom you are born.</p>
<p>If you are born to a well to do secular family, that will take yo one way,
if you are born to a poor family threatened by addiction, guns or warlords you life will move another way.</p>
<p>What you have to do, is find yourself, so that,
you are you, on either of those ends of spectrum.</p>
<p>You have to push away what you have been born into,
take your intellectual inheritance…</p>
<p>And make such choices in life,
that the elder you, will not only, not-regret, but be happy, and proud to have made them.</p>
<hr>
<p>Learning for real is basically your operating system,
as you unchain your self, to whatever you were born into, good or bad.</p>
<p>This is a question, about answering to your only master,
your elder self, including your elder self, on the last day of your life.</p>
<hr>
<p>The operating system upgrade, or what you will inherit,
from the books that end up constitution your intellectual inheritance.</p>
<p>Will give you some simple ideas,
that I will help yo to now, so that you start a step ahead.</p>
<p>You are charged with growing all the way up, never just just part way up,
and to grow all the way up and become an adult, means to become a great being.</p>
<p>The same kind of person, that yo as a child,
hoped that all the adults were.</p>
<p>And we have a duty to Humanity, to repair schools,
as we are just one enormous family.</p>
<p>We should not live split by levels of understanding and education,
and fractured by mutually incompatible, and equally made up indoctrination.</p>
<p>We certainly should not live in a state where children can be drafted and killed in wars,
ran by ghouls, who never cared to prevent them, or even knew what war is like.</p>
<p>And we must put an immediate end to living in states,
of mutually assured destruction, poverty, pollution, despeciation and anthropogenic climate change.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is impossible to give yo more guidance than this,
because you are infintely different from every other human being that exists, existed, and will exist.</p>
<p>As proof, consider the unique trail of wisdom that will call to you,
as you begin listening to the 10,000 books of your intellectual inheritance.</p>
<p>Stop memorizing for tests all of you, and never forget to remind your teachers,
that in a compromise between good and evil, only evil can profit.</p>
