Enduring Strength Glossary

### **Aerobic Conditioning**

Training that makes your heart and lungs stronger by keeping you moving for long periods—like jogging, walking fast, or dancing. "Aerobic" means "with oxygen," so you can breathe and talk while doing it.



### **Anaerobic Exercise**

Short bursts of intense effort—like sprinting or lifting very heavy weights. It's so intense your body can't get enough oxygen in time, so it burns energy faster. Our program uses mostly **aerobic** effort with light weights.



### **Bicep Curl**

A basic arm exercise where you lift a dumbbell by bending your elbow. It targets the **biceps**, the muscle on the front of your upper arm (aka your "flexing" muscle).



### **Cognitive Synchronization / Entrainment**

A fancy way of saying: your **brain matches the beat** of the music. When you move with music, your body and mind start syncing up—this boosts focus and helps you stay “in the zone.”



### **Cyclic Loading**

This means rotating between exercises so your muscles get a break without you stopping the workout. For example, curl → press → raise, then repeat. It keeps the workout going without total rest.



### **Dumbbell**

A small, handheld weight. Comes in many sizes—from 1 lb to over 100 lbs. This program uses **light dumbbells** (3–10 lbs) to keep your body moving safely and for longer.



### **Endurance**

Your body’s ability to keep going—walking, lifting, or dancing—without quitting or burning out. This program is all about building **deep, lasting endurance** in both body and mind.



### **Form**

How you move during an exercise. **Good form** keeps you safe and helps you work the right muscles. Sloppy form = injuries. Proper form = progress.



### **Flow State**

A feeling where you’re totally focused, calm, and in rhythm. Time flies, distractions disappear, and you feel *awesome*. Flow often happens when you move to music.



### **Interval Timer**

A timer with two countdowns: one for **work** and one for **rest**. Used to keep you moving without getting distracted or over resting. You can clip it to your belt and feel it vibrate even with headphones on.



### **Lateral Raise**

An exercise where you lift dumbbells out to the sides like bird wings. It works the **shoulder** muscles (specifically the deltoids) and makes your arms look strong and wide.



### **Load / Loading**

The amount of weight you're lifting. In our program, you “load” your body with dumbbells—but the goal is never to go *too* heavy. It’s about how **long** you can carry it.



### **Low Load Resistance**

Using **light weights** (3–10 lbs) instead of heavy weights. Low load is safer, especially for beginners and teens, and builds **muscle endurance** rather than max strength.



### **Muscular Endurance**

How long your muscles can keep going before they tire out. Think of holding a plank or lifting dumbbells for an hour. You don’t need big muscles—just ones that last.



### **Overhead Shoulder Press**

Lifting dumbbells from shoulder height straight up above your head. Works your **shoulders**, **arms**, and **upper back**. It’s one of our core movements.



### **Power Walking**

Walking quickly with purpose. It’s more intense than regular walking—arms swinging, heart rate up, like you mean business. It’s great cardio without impact.



### **Progression**

The way you get better—by slowly adding more weight, more time, or new movements. **Don’t jump too fast.** This program is all about slow, natural growth.



### **Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE)**

How hard you feel like you're working on a scale from 1 to 10.

* 1 = Super easy
* 10 = All out effort
 We aim for around **5–6**, where you’re challenged but not dying.



### **Repetition (Rep)**

One full movement of an exercise. Example: one full bicep curl = one rep.



### **Resistance Training**

Any exercise that uses weight or tension to build strength—like lifting dumbbells. In this program, we do **light resistance training** for **long periods**.



### **Rest Period**

The break between sets or movements. In this program, we try to **eliminate rest** by cycling exercises instead—your arms rest while your shoulders work, and so on.



### **Shuffle Dancing**

A fun dance style with fast footwork that pairs well with fitness. It’s a playful way to increase cardio and coordination once your body is conditioned.



### **Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy**

This is when your muscles grow in **size** because of high reps and volume—common in bodybuilders and in this program. Different from lifting heavy for strength, this style builds **lean, lasting muscle**.



### **Time Under Tension (TUT)**

How long your muscles are working during a set or workout. Longer = more endurance and growth. Our workouts aim for **huge TUT** without burning out.



### **Warm Up / Cool Down**

Before and after workouts, you ease into movement and slowly return to rest. Never skip it—it keeps you injury free.



### **Wrestling Singlet**

A tight, one piece athletic outfit worn by wrestlers. In this program, it's symbolic: it shows you're **not hiding**, that you're **committed**, and that **health > fashion**.
