            <p>I first closely examined Michigan when I was ten or so,
I was throwing darts at a map, in hopes of predicting my future.</p>
<p>The dart hit just west of Detroit,
so I studied it pondering if they had real Robot Cops.</p>
<p>I did notice the lakes,
but as a boy growing up by the Baltic sea…</p>
<p>My thought process was something like,
if they really were that great.. they wouldn&#39;t call them lakes.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now to be fair, once I had my fill of exploring Florida,
and the tiny islands of Florida Keys.</p>
<p>Said unto myself,
it is time to examine these lakes.</p>
<p>Being surrounded by them, I found a nearest highway,
and decided to drive due north until it ended by some beach.</p>
<p>And to this day there is no more reliable method,
to get at a proper adventure.</p>
<p>As highways,
highway.</p>
<p>I ended up on the central west coast of Michigan,
at a small town called Ludington.</p>
<hr>
<p>My love for seagulls begun with a clear injustice,
the first time I arrived at the Ludington beach.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here the first thing I saw, were cute starving seagulls,
standing beneath an angry and legally-binding-looking “do not feed the seagulls” sign.</p>
<p>Not once have I seen anything more cruel,
and promptly begun feeding them with everything I had.</p>
<p>Which was healty cheese puffs first,
but then nuts and seeds from my traimix.</p>
<p>I didn’t dare to give them candy,
though in part because I already pecked it all out.</p>
<hr>
<p>As I kept returning to Ludington,
I would often stop by the sigh, and secretly hand feed them one by one.</p>
<p>As seagull live up to 16 years, I like to think that to this day,
I am a god-grand-gand-father to some of Michigan’s population today.</p>
<p>I should mention here that The European Herring Gulls,
have been found to live up to 50 years – and what beautiful birds they are.</p>
<hr>
<p>My love and appreciation for the seagull begun,
when I realized they were helping me with my fitness training.</p>
<p>By demanding to eat much of my trail mix,
and other heathy snacks.</p>
<p>We’d sit an the Lake Beach together,
watching the tourists freaking out about finding seashells.</p>
<p>That I purchased in bulk earlier in the afternoon,
at the floral section of the distant supermarket.</p>
<p>Eating, healthy snacks together,
and when once I added up all the crumbs I shared.</p>
<p>It turned out,
to be just about half my calories for the day.</p>
<p>They helped me,
and I helped them.</p>
<hr>
<p>But my love for the seagull did not come into full bloom,
until the day I went to feed the Ludington State Park population.</p>
<p>Now the firs thing I must tell you about,
is quite possibly one of the most bizarre stories I know.</p>
<p>When I got done with feeding them,
I went to the main beach area, and begun brainlessly scanning around.</p>
<p>All kinds of people were having all kinds of fun,
but my brain kept flagging a group of teenagers.</p>
<p>Just bobbing up and down in the sand,
looking guilty as heck.</p>
<p>So, I inched closer to see a head sticking out of the sand,
they were digging a hole, and it was tall teenager deep.</p>
<p>And the next time they caught my attention,
I saw them lifting a huge driftwood.</p>
<p>As straight as you can imagine,
and as tall as a lampost.</p>
<p>And it suddenly slid into the hole they dug,
with a thump!</p>
<p>At which point they filled in the sides,
dis a little dance to stomp the sand around…</p>
<p>and just dispersed,
towards their corresponding families.</p>
<p>I looked at the now lonesome pole,
and just could not imagine the beach without it.</p>
<p>There was store near by, and the pole looked like it was the very thing,
that provided the store with electricity.</p>
<p>And a critical part of the electric infrastructure to boot,
which to be honest, was lacking at the beach.</p>
<hr>
<p>The teenagers found a driftwood that looked like a pole,
and spend half an afternoon installing it.</p>
<p>Towards the end, exhausted,
and crazed with heat.</p>
<p>But they did it,
and I am sure it stands to this day.</p>
<p>As who would want to mess with electricity,
at the beach.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, for the retelling, and perhaps a confession,
of what one of my seagulls was helped to achieve.</p>
<p>As the teenagers were digging the damn hole,
I’ve noticed a mom and her little daughter descending from the store.</p>
<p>The little girl clutching a toast she dropped,
or maybe some seeds or something.</p>
<p>The mother seemed annoyed,
like this was a trip that she did not bargain for.</p>
<p>But she fulfilled the daughters wish,
and the little girl holding to her moms hand lifted the snack to feed a seagull.</p>
<p>It was a really cute thing to see,
and I immediate appreciated what she was doing, bless her.</p>
<p>But as fate would have it, she same moment she lifted her snack,
was also one of the more notable moments in the seagull history.</p>
<p>And while it happened in the blink of an eye,
the sound of the event echoed, for a goddie long while.</p>
<p>And I personally believe, I will remember it for life,
as it sounded like this: (clap)</p>
<p>It was one of the largest shits a seagull ever gulled,
and it went straight at her head.</p>
<p>I looked at the mother,
and she was already gagging.</p>
<p>She quickly dragged her daughter away to the bathroom sink,
with a quirky smile, that bespoke…</p>
<p>Well at least she won’t ever,
want to feed the freaking seagulls again.</p>
<hr>
<p>I, in a small part almost remember,
feeding a fat seagull albatross looking bird.</p>
<p>And it would take an old albatross,
to lift so much cargo into the air.</p>
<p>There is no proof it was my feeding that caused this,
but that was a traimix load.</p>
<p>Poor little lady, now in the 20s,
probably hasn&#39;t fed a bird since.</p>
<hr>
<p>This morning a huge flock greeted me by the gym,
as if to check on my progress.</p>
<p>And I have not seen so much mischief and unique character,
since I left the wilderness for warmer climes.</p>
