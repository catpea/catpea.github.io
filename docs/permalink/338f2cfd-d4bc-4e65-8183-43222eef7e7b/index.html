            <p>Preamble:</p>
<p>Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and equal rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world,</p>
<p>Whereas it is essential to secure the right to life, liberty, security, universal basic income, effective education, and peace for every individual,</p>
<p>Whereas indoctrination of younger individuals, ineffective education, and war are hindrances to the realization of human rights and the flourishing of humanity,</p>
<p>Whereas privacy, security, and the preservation of personal identity are fundamental to human dignity and self-determination,</p>
<p>Whereas the pursuit of knowledge, critical thinking, and intellectual growth is a shared inheritance that enriches the human experience,</p>
<p>Now, therefore, The New Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims the following articles:</p>
<p>Article 1: Right to Life, Liberty, Security, Universal Basic Income, Effective Education, and Peace</p>
<p>All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are entitled to a Universal Basic Income (UBI) card, guaranteeing every individual access to financial resources necessary for the fulfillment of their basic needs, personal development, and the pursuit of a dignified life. This ensures that no person is deprived of opportunities due to economic disparities or societal inequalities.</p>
<p>Each human being has the inherent right to grow and reach their fullest potential, becoming compassionate, wise, and great beings. No individual, particularly children and young people, shall be subjected to indoctrination or psychological abuse that impedes their critical thinking, personal autonomy, and intellectual development. Such indoctrination shall be recognized as abuse and made illegal, safeguarding the rights of children and young people to grow with open minds, free from undue influence that hinders their capacity to think independently and make informed choices.</p>
<p>War, as a means of resolving conflicts between nations, is hereby declared illegal and in direct violation of the inherent right to life, peace, and security. All nations shall pursue peaceful means for the resolution of disputes, promoting dialogue, diplomacy, and cooperation. The use of force or threat of force as a tool of aggression or coercion shall be unequivocally condemned. The global community shall work collectively to foster understanding, reconciliation, and non-violent conflict resolution, ensuring that peace becomes the cornerstone of human interactions and international relations.</p>
<p>Effective education is a fundamental right that empowers individuals to reach their full potential, think critically, and contribute meaningfully to society. Education shall be comprehensive, accessible, and self-directed, nurturing intellectual curiosity, creativity, and a lifelong love of learning. It shall be free from indoctrination, ineffective teaching methods, and practices that hinder critical thinking. Ineffective education, which disables individuals from realizing their true potential, shall be deemed a violation of their rights and made illegal.</p>
<p>Real education does not rely on grading, ranking, or branding individuals with a GPA. It values individual progress, encourages collaborative learning, and celebrates diverse talents and skills. It fosters an environment that promotes intellectual exploration, critical analysis, and the development of well-rounded individuals who can adapt, innovate, and contribute to the betterment of society.</p>
<p>Every human being shall have the right to privacy and the protection of personal data. No person shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful surveillance, intrusion into their private life, or the unauthorized collection, use, or disclosure of their personal information. Safeguarding privacy is essential for fostering individual autonomy, freedom of expression, and the development of personal identity.</p>
<p>Every human being shall have the right to access and inherit the intellectual wealth of humanity. This includes access to all the important and life-changing books written by great beings, fostering knowledge, wisdom, and the continuous intellectual growth of individuals.</p>
<p>Article 2: Right to Equality, Universal Basic Income, and Non-Discrimination</p>
<p>Every human being is born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are entitled to full equality, including equal opportunities, without discrimination based on race, color, sex, language, beliefs, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth, or any other status.</p>
<p>To ensure equality and eradicate poverty, every individual shall be granted a Universal Basic Income (UBI) card, guaranteeing access to financial resources necessary for the fulfillment of basic needs, personal development, and social participation. This universal entitlement shall contribute to reducing economic disparities and fostering social cohesion.</p>
<p>Article 3: Right to Freedom from Indoctrination and Critical Thinking</p>
<p>Every human being has the right to freedom from indoctrination and the opportunity to engage in critical thinking. No individual, particularly children and young people, shall be subjected to indoctrination or psychological abuse that impedes their ability to think independently, question, and form their own beliefs and opinions.</p>
<p>Education systems shall prioritize the development of critical thinking skills, encourage open-mindedness, and foster intellectual curiosity, equipping individuals with the tools to navigate diverse perspectives and make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Article 4: Right to Peace and Prohibition of War</p>
<p>Every human being has the right to live in peace. All individuals and nations shall actively promote peace as a fundamental value and resolve conflicts through peaceful means.</p>
<p>The use of force or threat of force between nations is strictly prohibited. Nations shall prioritize diplomacy, dialogue, and peaceful negotiations to address disagreements and disputes, striving for a world free from the horrors of war.</p>
<p>Article 5: Right to Privacy, Security, and Protection of Personal Data</p>
<p>Every human being has the right to privacy and security. No person shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy, family, home, or correspondence.</p>
<p>Governments shall enact and enforce laws that protect personal data, ensuring its confidential and secure handling, and safeguarding individuals&#39; privacy rights in the digital age.</p>
<p>Article 6: Right to Effective Education and Self-Directed Learning</p>
<p>Every human being has the right to effective education that promotes personal growth, critical thinking, and lifelong learning. Education systems shall provide equitable access to quality education, irrespective of background or circumstances.</p>
<p>Real education is self-directed, encouraging individuals to explore their interests, pursue their passions, and engage in meaningful learning experiences. Education shall prioritize the development of knowledge, skills, and values necessary for personal fulfillment, active citizenship, and the advancement of human rights.</p>
