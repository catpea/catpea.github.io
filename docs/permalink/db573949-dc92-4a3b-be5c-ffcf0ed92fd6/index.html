          <div class="card-text post-content p-3">
            <p>When hearing of critical thinking,
think of critiquing thinking, tearing ideas apart and examining them.</p>
<p>Critical thinking is very delicate,
as it relies on a solid foundation of knowledge.</p>
<p>And it is not just about acquisition,
of functional and authentic knowledge.</p>
<p>It is about you dumping what is false,
but you have been taught, or learned to believe to be true.</p>
<p>To tear things apart and examine them,
you need a workbench, with tools for thinking.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let me show you some falsehoods that you are clinging to,
your High School or College GPA being one of the most important things.</p>
<p>It isn’t, in fact, adults that mention it, are seen as infantile,
eventually you internalize that GPA is tweaked by teachers and stained by cramming.</p>
<p>It is not a very valid or authentic measure of anything,
it is a make believe thing.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are people who work hard and take great care of their 4.0,
but, they are not focused on comprehension, just passing tests.</p>
<p>Comprehension, which is a foundation of real and authentic knowledge,
would interfere with in-authentic standardized education.</p>
<p>You would fail most tests, as you would be too busy learning for real,
there would be no time for pretending to learn the way textbooks expect you to.</p>
<p>Text books want you to follow their web of knowledge,
in great part, because of matching tests and the state GPA requirements.</p>
<p>Instead of learning for real, you are given a hint of education,
that will appear as real due to the equally ineffective matching tests.</p>
<hr>
<p>Following webs of knowledge, to connect things together,
requires authentic curiosity, that must come from within you.</p>
<p>It is something deeply personal, it is unique to you,
a lot of people have their predispositions pushed out of the way.</p>
<p>In favor of standardized education, the only people that thrive here,
are teachers, and those whose curiosities largely matched what the school was teaching.</p>
<hr>
<p>A person who has been growing up with some predispositions for being an artist,
will do great in the art class.</p>
<p>A person with parents that present numbers, forces and formulas,
as emergent tools, machines, and teach their child to see into mathematics.</p>
<p>Will raise a child who will excel at mathematics,
because they won’t just have surface knowledge but visions of what lies beneath.</p>
<p>These cases are held up as examples, of people who learn hard and succeed,
and in a pretty serious way they are the opposite, they didn’t let school ruin them.</p>
<hr>
<p>Now, I don’t want to give you the idea that for example, programming class,
can actually teach you to be a programmer.</p>
<p>In fact it is overwhelmingly more likely to push you away from it,
because of what a naive disaster it is, and how it teachers out of sequence.</p>
<hr>
<p>A moment ago you believed in your GPA,
now you have been reminded that knowledge demands comprehension.</p>
<p>Memorization, or as the case is temporary memorization,
is just theater, and you forget everything after graduation.</p>
<p>When you get at your intellectual inheritance,
valuing authenticity, and standing in relentless pursuits of excellence.</p>
<p>Becomes an active component in your decision making,
and with all the wisdom you continue inheriting from countless wise books.</p>
<p>You will now tear and examine all the ideas in-front of you,
to check what else they may hide, and what impact that has on you.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moreover, critical thinking, is what scientists do,
the scientific method is all about tearing ideas apart.</p>
<p>The key component of a good Doctor or Scientist, however,
is not just examination, bu the ability change beliefs, so that they match truth.</p>
<p>Interesting question: can you become a scientist by just being a really good critical thinker?
Or do you actually need a diploma, and a good GPA.</p>
<p>I’d love to pose this as a question that you should answer on your own,
but I am happy to announce, that yes, you can.</p>
<p>You do not need a diploma to become a scientist that does science,
the first students of natural philosophy were some of the greatest scientists.</p>
<p>They didn’t care for diplomas,
they cared for facts, truth, clarity, and above all evidence.</p>
<p>Critical thinking is an on-ramp towards science,
and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s83NzS93wXY">diploma does not mean that much</a> certainly not at first..</p>
<hr>
<p>There are no easy ways of explain everything precisely,
for the exact same reason that standardized education is so ineffective.</p>
<p>To comprehend something you must move,
at your own pace, and in the sequence that matches your knowledge and curiosity.</p>
<p>And there is no perfectly reliable map,
that is what teachers or AI should be doing just steering you in the right direction.</p>
<p>Where you can begin examining whatever calls to you,
this could be something that no teacher would see as related.</p>
<p>But all the things that your curiosity called you to,
are intricately connected within you.</p>
<p>All those curiosites combine to help you create qunique inventions,
that few other people in the world would think up.</p>
<p>And again, standardized education removes your curiosities,
and tells you what you need to learn, and that just makes you a depressed worker.</p>
<hr>
<p>You will be pleasantly surprised, I hope,
at just how you are supposed to get at your intellectual inheritance.</p>
<p>Which I would define as the thing that enables you to resume,
where the great beings before you, left off.</p>
<p>First of all you will need narrated books, especially when you are very young,
but also as you are working on your vocabulary, and picture of the world.</p>
<p>And then, you will need to make room,
for all that spoken knowledge carefully read to you by narrators.</p>
<p>And that means,
adventure, and before your parents check, there are no substitutes.</p>
<p>You and your parents, and later alone, will have to at the very least,
section hike all the beautiful parts of…</p>
<p>The Appalachian, Pacific Crest and Continental Dive Trails,
or their equivalents in your part of the world.</p>
<p>You are nature, not a machine or a worker,
it should come as no surprise that you need nature for peace and comprehension.</p>
<p>And if I may, begin with the adventure books first,
because like you, no adventurer has ever set off, merely for adventures sake.</p>
<p>There is great wisdom about each and every story,
and even in their tragedy or loss, you will find lessons of safety and protection.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, everything is connected,
you don’t learn the moment you sit at your desk, you are always learning.</p>
<p>Everything you do has impact on everything else,
and most of your curiosities emerge when you are little.</p>
<p>Do not sell your self short,
you become a scientist the day you embrace the scientific method as dear.</p>
<p>And begin your quest for growing all the way up towards becoming a great being,
the day you accept your intellectual inheritance.</p>
<p>And spend your days listening to all the clear thinking intellectuals,
who made our world better and worth advancing still.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t worry at what the adults have to say about what science is or it is not,
learn how to think about science from the greatest scientists and thinkers that wrote.</p>
<p>Begin at your local library,
in the adventure section of narrated books.</p>
