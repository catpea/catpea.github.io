            <p>Let us begin with a kind of conspiracy theory, you live in a box, some say a prison with invisible walls,
while it is emergent and not designed, it is enforced.</p>
<p>Your representatives assume that if they listen to you,
you will destabilize the box, so they protect it.</p>
<p>They’ll let you live the pretty silly fantasy of pursuit of happiness,
while ensuring that Real Education and Universal Basic Income, never pass.</p>
<p>They point to drug legalization, gangs, protests, and Brexit even,
and laugh among themselves saying…</p>
<p>If we let them have what they want,
they will destroy themselves and the country.</p>
<hr>
<p>But that is a kind of madness, a confabulation,
broken groupthink, desire to feel superior, and an overwhelming amount of greed.</p>
<p>There is no better explanation for this madness,
of just looking at symptoms and making crap up to fit their preconceived notions.</p>
<p>Than an old lonesome quote, by dear Kurt Vonnegut:
“True terror is to wake up one morning and discover that your high school class is running the country.”</p>
<p>Yup, the world leaders and representatives, are not grownups,
they are just aged nineteen-year-olds.</p>
<p>They didn&#39;t create the box, it emerged out of complexity and chaos,
they reinforce it, because they don’t know anything, but what they tell each other.</p>
<p>It is one of those, “forget what you’ve learned in college kid,
here is what really goes on, behind the closed doors”.</p>
<p>Resisting any and all change, goes really well with all this,
since they don’t know how to do anything, they don’t <strong>have to</strong> do anything.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s take a look at drug legalization for a moment, to contrast what they see,
with what really is going on.</p>
<p>Drug use is a mental disorder, not an incurable disease, but a disorder,
it is born from pain, poverty, fear, terror, homelessness isolation, loss,  hopelessnes.</p>
<p>A normal person wouldn&#39;t do drugs, they would see it,
as pissing into their brain, or worse.</p>
<p>An in deed a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-0KfwFCMRM">famous rat experiment shows, that when the creatures are teared well, they stop seeking trash relief, and live</a>.</p>
<p>But, the high school class that was runnig the country at the time,
criminalized it, for one it was a great way to get elected.</p>
<p>Eveyone you and I included can agree, that drug use is revolting, disgusting,</p>
<p>But by criminalizing drugs, they also criminalized,
feeling pain, poverty, fear, terror, homelessness, isolation, loss, hopelessnes.</p>
<p>For the people, who have no support, who grew in in a culture of drug use,
who might not have even see in as something disgusting.</p>
<p>And as a result, police started destroying whatever was left of their lives,
especially the young people, the most vulnerable of us.</p>
<p>To put a quick and desperate end to this, in an age of for profit prisons,
without saying a damn word, we started legalizing this disgusting thing.</p>
<p>There is no way to stop the prison industry, in a world ran by make-believe leaders,
who get baited and pushed around by people who are much more cunning then them.</p>
<p>The powerful well established multi-generational groups of families,
behind large enterprises.</p>
<p>Wherever there is money, a new industry will pop up,
it will have no soul, it will have no heart, it will have no eyes, just that old ravenous feeling of greed.</p>
<hr>
<p>Where politicians look down at us for legalizing,
the shortest possible way to ruin your life.</p>
<p>What really happened, is us, giving the teenagers, who messed up,
as much as we can, so that can recover without a criminal record that will destroy whatever is left.</p>
<p>That is of course not the story you hear,
that is because everyone turns it into whatever they want to believe in.</p>
<p>And if they are unable to stop, or in other words addicted,
they will tell you anything that will win an argument an move on.</p>
<p>Or whatever is left of them, at the moment,
to move on, to get to and through another day.</p>
<p>You see the actual result, the effect,
an addict can have another day, another chance at recovery, without criminal records.</p>
<p>The word recreational, is a good bait,
to make decriminalization happen, it will get he votes necessary.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is a temporary fix though, it is a bandaid,
last time I was on my bicycle trail.</p>
<p>I saw a bunch of 12 year olds lined up like Hank Hill and his crew,
smoking their older brothers or dads, mental disorder.</p>
<p>There is no way out of addiction,
without removing the error or terror that put them in the first place.</p>
<hr>
<p>Which brings us to the meaty part of this strange poem,
as soon as it is possible, before pain pushes people into self medicating by pissing into their brains.</p>
<p>We have to get them out of the box, the strange invisible prison,
that is causing all the discomfort, and harm, and pain.</p>
<p>That is just two things, that are closely networked, or intertwined together,
meaning that you can’t have one without the other.</p>
<p>That we can’t do it one at a time, arose out of chaos of the human condition,
it is a two part locking mechanism.</p>
<p>On one side you have poverty, that will stress you out so hard,
that you will be unable to read books or learn.</p>
<p>And on the other side, is un-education, which will keep you in povery,
twisting, churning, causing fractures, and even addicion.</p>
<p>To beak this lock, on our box, reinforced by wannabe leaders,
from ineffective teachers to useless prime ministers and the like.</p>
<p>We need a key,
which unravels the inter-dynamics of poverty and un-education.</p>
<p>The key is two parts, on one end you have effective education,
that enables children to inherit entire lifetimes of wisdom from books and adventures.</p>
<p>On the other end, is something that you have already been convinced of as being evil,
the end of poverty, today known as Universal Basic Income.</p>
<p>To exit the box, you forge a key that is the opposite,
of what keeps the invisible walls standing.</p>
<p>And as a result, the positions of leadership that are today plugged up,
by spoiled teens who aged well into their 70s, without achieving anything.</p>
<p>Will become filled, with young people who surpassed the mental capacity,
of these retarded leaders, by the time they hit 25 or 30.</p>
<hr>
<p>In closing, this incredible world can only be created,
by young people all around the world who hacked the locking mechanism.</p>
<p>Not something that many people will do,
because it requires puking your guts out in some parkin lot from trash food.</p>
<p>As you rise, in your courage, in your dignity, in your unbrakability,
to face pain, poverty, fear, terror, homelessness, isolation, loss, and hopelessnes.</p>
<p>Alone, alone, alone,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6_QUhUPrF4">against all fucking odds</a>…</p>
<p>As your favorite narrated books play in your headphones granting you all the tools you need,
all the culture of great beings that you were missing, and break the lock.</p>
<p>By curing your un-education,
and rendering the terror of poverty meaningless.</p>
<p>I imagine like Universal Basic Income, Narrated Books, have been attacked,
by those who don’t want to be inconvenienced, by NOT pissing into their brains.</p>
<p>But the text on a page, is the same as musical notation on paper,
you wouldn&#39;t listen to a melody on paper, you shouldn&#39;t merely read books.</p>
<p>We are story tellers and story listeners,
to properly inherit wisdom, and make connections for more, we need to hear it.</p>
<p>If you are willing to take this gut wrenching journey,
then I have some tools for you.</p>
<p>Two concepts,
that maybe unfamiliar to you.</p>
<p>Content Of Character, as the thing deep inside our minds,
the sum of all our history, and how we rose.</p>
<p>I heard those words,
in a speech by Martin Luther King, Jr, on my adventure to the ocean.</p>
<p>And the concept of Subtle Analogies, or reasoning by subtle analogy,
this is a pretty definition of wisdom, and the precursor to Synthesis Of Wisdom.</p>
<p>And I have a sample box for you that you can study,
that you can examine, and comprehend.</p>
<p>And perhaps most importantly, you will be able to examine locks,
how concepts can combine to create a lock, or a finger trap.</p>
<p>Be careful, here, most human beings are born to this box,
but it is old, it can no longer contain us, and is in fact disintegrating.</p>
<p>Don’t cling to it, don’t try to get back inside it,
but rather study it, how it captures some part of you, and perhaps stuck like glue.</p>
<p>Search a popular video site for
“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sRBGGzdsl8">Richard Dawkins: The God Delusion + Questions and Answers</a>”</p>
<p>This should be about 1 hour 50 minutes long,
you may find copies of just the QA, but that maybe something you may appreciate later.</p>
<p>Pay special attention, the timing of the laughter of the students,
if you ever lose hope in humanity…</p>
<p>The timing of the laughter here, show that the kids are tough,
they sense the invisible prison walls, it is in our nature.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to view a couple of hundred videos,
that are related to this one.</p>
<p>And the my second recommendation has something more,
this video is not just about breaking out of invisible prisons…</p>
<p>But like in the many books you will encounter in your journeys,
this video helps you inherit not just wisdom…</p>
<p>But also some of the class of these great beings,
you befriend them, and in a way start thinking like them, thus enter their culture.</p>
<p>The often broken down in two parts, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOMjEJ3JO5Q">an update with Ayaan Hirsi Ali</a>,
who wasn&#39;t able to join them in the first session.</p>

<hr>
<p>Lastly, I have a book recommendation by the funny Mr. Bill Bryson,
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=a+short+history+of+nearly+everything">A Short History Of Nearly Everything</a></p>
<p>There are two reasons why this book is special, the opening, describes effects of ineffective education,
and the book it self, shows yo how a normal person learns.</p>
<p>My favorite part is the “Not Another Phylum” bit,
it got me burst out in laugher as I was jogging in Ann Arbor late at night.</p>
<p>Pondering schools coudn’t never afford to go to,
for one I coudn’t afford to pretend that memorization is education.</p>
<p>But the most illustrative part,
is Mr. Bryson visiting the Stromatolites in Australia.</p>
<p>That,
is how you learn.</p>
<p>And the book you write in the processes,
is your diploma.</p>
<p>If it so happens that you are the person that will fix schools,
know that more important than anything is travel.</p>
<p>Our brains need geographic motion,
preferably by foot as in case of the Triple Crown of Hiking, AT, PCT, and CDT.</p>
<p>But our world needs student exchange,
something that is necessary for world peace…</p>
<p>And becomes possible,
with a world wide Universal basic Income Program.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the absence of teachers,
you must become a teacher.</p>
