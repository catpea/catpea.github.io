          <div class="card-text post-content p-3">
            <p>I descended down my ancient dune,
for a lavish bath in Lake Michigan.</p>
<p>That from where I was standing,
was my own, and I shared it with nobody.</p>
<p>Climbing the final bump in the sand,
I discovered I was not alone.</p>
<p>Or rather,
I discovered I can shriek.</p>
<p>And like a hot flash,
it happens automatically.</p>
<p>In this case it was triggered,
by the biggest snake I have ever encountered.</p>
<p>From what I remember,
and the memory is somewhat blurry.</p>
<p>It’s head,
was the size of my fist.</p>
<p>My instinct told me,
that the coiled body indicated…</p>
<p>That it was getting ready to pounce at me,
at which point, still shrieking, I simply took to the air.</p>
<p>No doubt, for a split second, at least,
impressing some of the near by seagulls.</p>
<p>If not downright worrying the leader,
that I was about to join them.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let me tell you, an even like this changes you,
you never frolic through the bush again.</p>
<p>And when you come across a patch of grass of a grassy plain,
you mutter to yourself.</p>
<p>&quot;There are blepping snakes in,
in that bleeling plains&quot;</p>
<p>It is not a question of fear,
bur rather of respect.</p>
<p>Briefly becoming a shrieking seagull, reminded me…
that I was not in fact alone.</p>
<p>And that I was sharing my little wilderness
with many a fanged creature, and then some.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am no stranger to thunder,
in fact I experienced snow thunder twice.</p>
<p>And the first time made me run so fast,
that I might have broken the sound barrier.</p>
<p>Just last year I experienced what sounded,
like a mini Tunguska Event.</p>
<p>A single thunder, so loud,
that the whole suburb not only heard it, but still remember it.</p>
<p>In one of my first outings,
I watched a storm roll over.</p>
<p>Where I had to sleep between the poles of my tent,
laying flat like starfish on the ground.</p>
<p>I was on my way for a walk into the wilderness,
I was preparing to stay at.</p>
<p>I rented a camp site for the night, as it was raining,
and I wanted to scout everything out.</p>
<p>And as I was about to pass a large camper,
and nodded hello to the driver.</p>
<p>That is when it happened,
we didn’t see the lightening maybe due to cloud cover.</p>
<p>But the thunder went off,
right above our heads, right above the tree we were under.</p>
<p>He jumped, and I shrieked,
though this time internally, having mastered shrieking the first time.</p>
<p>Though I felt like I became a scary cat,
covered with goose bumps and hair standing up.</p>
<p>We stood there for a few seconds, frozen,
as if waiting for a second strike.</p>
<p>And that is when I noticed that the man’s nerves,
were already frayed.</p>
<p>Thunder, and rain, is why he was packing up,
“we’re leaving” -- he said with resolve.</p>
<p>Perhaps so that his wife could hear it,
and calm <strong>her</strong> nerves down.</p>
<p>I didn’t sense anybody else,
but I could see how she just woke up from her afternoon nap.</p>
<hr>
<p>They were a team, she charted the next adventure,
and he did the driving.</p>
<p>I would not be surprised, if perhaps their adventures,
didn’t in fact end with autumn.</p>
<p>But they simply drove south, where it is warmer,
to revisit all their favorite spots down in Florida.</p>
<p>They certainly didn’t dive up to Michigan,
to enjoy the weather.</p>
<p>The thing about lake Michigan is that,
is that the weather changes there fast.</p>
<p>It was sunny and fresh by morning- I observed ,
while now setting up at my new camp site.</p>
<p>Miles away from campers,
and their jittery disenchantment.</p>
<p>The rainy weather did bring flies along,
I don’t understand the process.</p>
<p>But for a couple of days,
the beaches were peppered.</p>
<p>With what looked like regular house flies,
maybe it was the wind, or the weather.</p>
<p>Eventually I found a beach free of them,
and as I was frolicking.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see a kayaker,
with full camping gear slowly paddling along.</p>
<p>He asked if the files were everywhere,
“just the shore” I said, “...and they are clearing up” I added.</p>
<p>But I can’t tell you,
how amazed I was.</p>
<p>That someone chose
not drag their gear though trails an beaches.</p>
<p>And instead, took a kayak out,
packed it with gear…</p>
<p>And went off scouting,
for a neat beach, from the lake side.</p>
<hr>
<p>My third shriek,
was actually filled with fright.</p>
<p>There was no making sense of it,
and what I started doing…</p>
<p>Was listening,
to whether or not it is getting closer.</p>
<p>I was camping in a secluded spot,
so maybe if I didn’t move a muscle.</p>
<p>The Freaking monster,
would not notice that I was there.</p>
<hr>
<p>Earlier in the day, I saw,
a bunch of people assembling for a nigh of drinking.</p>
<p>But this was way after midnight,
and coming from the opposite direction.</p>
<p>At first I thought maybe it was a fox,
but is sounded like it was yelling a name.</p>
<p>So in the seconds that I was abruptly awaken,
at what seemed like 2AM.</p>
<p>Still tired from a day of hiking,
I assumed it was a common variety monster witch out for a snack.</p>
<p>I lay there listening to the screams,
for what seemed like 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Until finally, I heard a mans voice,
and figured she will be fed fo the night.</p>
<p>I actually figured it was one of the campers,
who foolishly went for a five mile walk to get more booze.</p>
<p>And whatever landmarks she tried to remember,
failed her.</p>
<p>Not just because things look different on the way back,
but that there were two woodland coves.</p>
<p>And she,
needed to walk a bit further.</p>
<p>But let me tell you something,
she did not sound like lady to me.</p>
<p>It was not a beautiful voice,
it was a series of cruel angry screams.</p>
<p>And though I am a gentleman,
I would not go down there, while she kept screaming like that.</p>
<p>I was just too scared,
let me tell you, the beach didn’t need two screaming idiots that night.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is one more event,
that gave me great pause at Nordhouse.</p>
<p>After few weeks of camping,
I returned to the camper zone to clean up.</p>
<p>And went over to their announcement area,
where they pin various rules, and oblations.</p>
<p>I brainlessly scanned most of it,
and as I turned away from it, I did a double take.</p>
<p>Because right in the middle of the damn board,
a sign announced “This is Bear Country”.</p>
<p>Well, I had no idea, I thought it was just,
pouncing snakes, wise raccoons, tame deer, cheerful seagulls, and a porcupine.</p>
<p>Now I was left wandering,
how many times I was staled by a damn dirty bear.</p>
<hr>
<p>I think this was the time,
of the most interesting thing that happened to me at Nordhouse.</p>
<p>I don’t want to pass this chance,
to retell the event, as it is one of the most precious things I own.</p>
<p>There was a couple of loud ladies in a camper,
on the other site of the camping area.</p>
<p>They were lovely, but they would play their radio,
and make noises, and laugh too loud.</p>
<p>I loved it, tough, I appreciated it, I was glad they were there,
because they reminded me of Thelma and Louise.</p>
<p>And on the day of my departure,
after many weeks at the wilderness.</p>
<p>As I was scribbling in my journal,
I once again heard the camper door slam open.</p>
<p>And the cackle,
of seriously cheerful ladies.</p>
<p>As far as I could tell,
the woman was working on the breakfast fire.</p>
<p>By means, of what sounded like,
smashing thick tree stumps together to crack them open.</p>
<p>It sounded like a hell of a workout,
and she was at it for a goodie long while.</p>
<p>Once the wooden installation took shape,
in her fire ring, she bent over the final time…</p>
<p>And fired the most powerful series of shots I have ever heard,
right out of her butt.</p>
<p>It was a sound to behold, that echoed around the camp,
and silenced all the birds in the area.</p>
<p>Frankly, up until that moment, in my sheltered life,
I wasn’t even sure if ladies did such things.</p>
<p>I squinted to see if she didn’t collapse,
and instead I saw her steady herself.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath, of fresh air, and yell out,
with a southern accent and a sleezy tone.</p>
<p>“Pullllll maaaaaaaaaaa finga”, and then she skedaddled,
her hair now in a mess, back into her camper.</p>
<p>Where she surely needed to change, and lay down,
and now I realize, her friend probably reminded her that everyone head that.</p>
<p>And we did, lots of people paused their morning chores,
and some still looked towards their camper long after the birds started chirruping again.</p>
