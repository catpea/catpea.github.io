            <p>You are to never see another human in negative light,
unless negative is all they do.</p>
<p>And if that is the case, stop speaking to them,
do not play their games, do not fight them.</p>
<p>If you ever ask yourself what bullies what from you,
it is to make you a bully out of you too.</p>
<p>They want you to hurt them,
and they want you to win.</p>
<p>They want you to snarl like them,
they want you to be like them.</p>
<p>So that for a moment, as they corrupt you,
they can feel like it is the new normal.</p>
<p>They can feel,
like they ar normal again.</p>
<hr>
<p>I am one of the last remaining shit kicking boy scouts,
no alcohol, no drugs, but also, no friends.</p>
<p>Nobody likes,
a boy scout.</p>
<p>Despite that one of the first things at my gym,
was boys accusing me of using drugs.</p>
<p>I was a fat guy, and I don’t know why,
but one boy pointed at my water bottle.</p>
<p>And said that is his gear,
that is gym slang for drugs.</p>
<p>But that was my nasty, cheap,
energy berry drink from the superkarket.</p>
<p>It was the only time I ever tasted,
the devil’s a$s.</p>
<p>I now make my own milder drink mix,
with electrolytes.</p>
<p>I am still overweight,
so I workout hard.</p>
<hr>
<p>Shortly thereafter, another boy said,
I wonder what we would find if we tested his bottle.</p>
<p>Rice flower, it is used as a buffering agent,
to slow down the release of the energy mix.</p>
<p>Then, a couple noticed me drinking green stuff,
that was just a title bit of mouth wash.</p>
<p>As I had to go to the dentist,
because of a broken tooth.</p>
<p>Last year a young lady filmed the rice flower for 45 seconds,
and, again, what is in your drink came up yesterday.</p>
<hr>
<p>When I fist stepped into a coffeshop, in Michigan,
the now dads, were doing drugs as teenagers.</p>
<p>It was seen as cool,
I gave care and advice, but no friendship.</p>
<p>Drugs meant people were given bad culture,
so they were just a symptom.</p>
<p>Alcohol and temporary relationships usually followed,
and lies, and manipulations were eveywhere.</p>
<p>I still though of troublemakers as friends,
and when I finally left I cried for ages.</p>
<hr>
<p>In fact, I once met a Valkyrie,
out on mission of vengeance.</p>
<p>And she taught me that people cry,
in a million ways.</p>
<p>She was crying about what was done to her,
angry people who just want to hate, cry.</p>
<p>And when I write about losing my friends,
I cry too.</p>
<hr>
<p>But there was no alternative,
just like you can’t fight a bully.</p>
<p>You got to take your stuff and leave,
if you have friends like that.</p>
<p>They are the creating the problems,
you are hoping to fix.</p>
<p>It is an endless procession,
of self destruction.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even my oldest friend,
from high school, from the very class I dropped out.</p>
<p>Becasue the biology teacher,
said that “Weed is an Herb”.</p>
<p>When she invited me for a birth day,
people were smoking drugs behind her garage.</p>
<p>And some recently released soldier kid,
tried to fight me.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t even know I was in a fight,
until she jumped in to break it up.</p>
<p>Military broke the poor kid,
now he was violent and drunk.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ve never been drunk, and this was one of the moments,
that showed me I don’t belong there.</p>
<p>It took a couple more events lie this,
to just say, I don’t want to come to see you.</p>
<p>It was dangers, insulting, stupid,
and always involved drugs an alcohol somehow.</p>
<p>Each time I visited my friends,
they were deeper away, from who they were supposed to be.</p>
<hr>
<p>Those drugs are still stupid, but legal now,
and there is even a dispensary three minutes from where I live.</p>
<hr>
<p>You see why I am being accused,
of having weird shit in my water bottle.</p>
<p>Parents have betrayed their children,
and some will fight them the fuck back.</p>
<hr>
<p>I remember when my school friend,
became an addict, this was still when it was illegal.</p>
<p>I remember the exact words and intonation, it was her uncle,
and he said “You are old enough now”.</p>
<p>He made it sound like it was a rite of passage,
but he was just copping with being a fucking loser.</p>
<p>She tried to stop a couple of times,
but all her friends did it.</p>
<p>She eventually saw me as the one that is odd,
abandoning my friends was the loudest thing I could say to them.</p>
<p>It was best,
for all.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even without legalization,
you maybe face a turd like my friend did.</p>
<p>And you have to treat them,
like a bully.</p>
<p>You have to understand,
that they are trying to make you one of them.</p>
<p>So that they can feel normal,
but the only way they can become normal is by going to rehab.</p>
<p>You have to learn to resist,
and even to walk away.</p>
<p>You must protect your mind,
you have to protect your dignity.</p>
<p>And speak loud and clear,
when describing people trying to get you to use drugs.</p>
<p>They are not your family,
they are not your fiends, they are your destroyers.</p>
<hr>
<p>Many users will be deeply offended,
but I am only reminding them who they once were.</p>
<p>I am asking them to go to rehab,
and grow into powerful and noble and dignified adults.</p>
<p>Who can serve as an inspiration to children,
not as the means of destruction of the brightest within them.</p>
<p>I am a big fan of the West Point Cadet Code,
A cadet will not lie, cheat, steal, or tolerate those who do.</p>
<p>That last part is my favorite part,
it ask you to rise.</p>
<p>Those of you who have already crossed the line,
I ask you to be more than just offended.</p>
<p>I ask you for rage, for fury,
for the best within you.</p>
<p>So that you have all the energy you need,
to challenge life, rather than let it bend you.</p>
<p>Go shopping, get a back pack, three season tent,
and especially a little pink shovel.</p>
<p>And go, Walk the Appalachian, Pacific Crest,
and Continental Divide trails.</p>
<p>Learn to say no, learn to keep moving,
and when you make it to the end of your third trail.</p>
<p>Become a guide,
so that others may follow in your footsteps.</p>
<hr>
<p>The rest of you,
rain your wrath.</p>
<p>And rise to no end,
hand on 10 minutes more, if that is all you have.</p>
<p>But learn to walk away,
as soon as you can.</p>
<hr>
<p>I don’t know what drugs do,
but I ten tell they make your life pass you by.</p>
<p>They not only make you need more drugs,
but trick you into thinking that you can’t live without them.</p>
<p>You have to rise, you have to learn to grow,
and grow all the way up, until you become a great being.</p>
<p>You’ll know what to do fro there,
but until then, rain your wrath, kicking and screening.</p>
<p>Resist, and leave,
find a better world.</p>
