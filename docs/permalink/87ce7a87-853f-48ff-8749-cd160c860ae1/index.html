          <div class="card-text post-content p-3">
            <p>Philosophers are always ten times smarter than we think,
the moment you understand something the philosopher said.</p>
<p>The moment you see the vulnerable human, who could have done better,
is just the philosopher, lovingly, and gently reaching out to help you rise much higher.</p>
<hr>
<p>To get us started, some say that fighting styles and equipment,
arose from practicing martial arts with work tools, or whatever was on hand.</p>
<p>So that peasants could practice unnoticed,
until they became powerful enough to set themselves free.</p>
<hr>
<p>Considering that victors write history,
the allegory of the cave might have been smuggling a weapon.</p>
<hr>
<p>The allegory, on it surface, asks us to imagine ourselves to have been born,
chained in a cave, facing a wall, where we can only see the shadows of what is going on behind us.</p>
<p>I must emphasize here, that in order to understand the allegory correctly,
you have to become one of those trapped in the cave.</p>
<p>(You must avoid thinking of them as really unfortunate people,
who are stuck in the cave, as that won’t help you understand the allegory.)</p>
<p>So here, from this miserable position of this unfair existence,
we learn what philosophy and her daughters, the sciences, are for.</p>
<p>It is for constructing frameworks, and pathways, to infer about the source of the shadows,
to cast theories that can explain the outside world, what it must look like.</p>
<p>The allegory shows what a philosopher is,
he is the gad fly to the state, more than powerful enough to set the world free.</p>
<p>Just as soon as the Philosopher intuits, or infers the outside world,
they will aim to set everyone free.</p>
<p>Though until the others see it,
the philosopher may sound, a bit crazy, mumbling about the skies and the sun.</p>
<hr>
<p>It is a good story, that shows Philosophers and Scientists,
are great escape artists, or students of reality and great discoverers.</p>
<p>They don’t need to be told if there are walls around them or not,
they will think, dig, and crawl through tunnels, because discovery is their business.</p>
<hr>
<p>You may be High School, or College, cheerfully marching on,
looking for a edge to tip the scales for some presentation.</p>
<p>Though you want to breeze through it,
there is a small splinter in your mind right now.</p>
<p>It resonates, because you understood something,
but you don’t know where it goes – and have no time or space anyway.</p>
<hr>
<p>You know you are in the cave,
you felt it all your life.</p>
<p>If you just shut yourself down,
and do the chores – you won’t get yelled at.</p>
<p>If you just keep going forward,
the other kids won’t notice or ridicule you.</p>
<p>And here comes the big one,
if you just cram, the teacher will let you pass.</p>
<p>That’s your wall, right now,
three is more to it, career, and other stuff – it gets bigger.</p>
<hr>
<p>But what about… behind you?
What about the business of discovery.</p>
<p>Did you figure out about Socrates yet?
He didn’t lay down and die worried about chickens.</p>
<p>They told him,
it is either him or the students he taught.</p>
<hr>
<p>You see, the allegory in the allegory of the cave is very useful packaging,
but the cave is a weapon, a tool for thinking.</p>
<p>The whole, is aimed at undoing your indoctrination,
first by example, then by explaining to you what a philosopher is.</p>
<p>And asking you to by subtle analogy to the people in the cave,
undo your indoctrination.</p>
<p>You have to ask a lot of questions, spend a moment with Henry at the Walden Pond,
and then head on to Mount Katahdin, find the white blaze, and begin walking the AT.</p>
<p>You have to hurry to get there, because the longer you spend in the cave,
the more you will have to lose, before you can walk the trails.</p>
<p>Once you get to Springer Mountain gown in Georgia,
you have to prepare to walk the Pacific Crest Trail…</p>
<p>And then safely cross the Continental Divide Trail,
it will take you years, sometimes it takes many years.</p>
<p>The three tails,
are the Triple Crown – and few have even walked it thrice.</p>
<hr>
<p>What is this really, you want to know,
you see, or more precisely, you can’t see your shackles – it is called an allegory of the cave for reason.</p>
<p>You never get to see the shackles,
and your walls are perfectly invisible.</p>
<p>Indoctrination is a prison you don’t know you are in,
and the stress, fear, doubt, disbelief, poverty…</p>
<p>Will keep you from reading books, that hope to teach you large and integrated lessons,
you will be unable to follow the other philosophers, clear thinkers, and great beings.</p>
<p>The trail, is so long, to make room in your mind,
for your intellectual inheritance.</p>
<p>The thousands of books, written by different clear thinkers,
from different perspectives, in hopes of helping you build a bridge.</p>
<p>From wherever you are, towards growing up,
towards growing all the way up…</p>
<p>Until you too become a great being,
and make your own lasting contributions to human kind.</p>
<hr>
<p>Plato created the allegory of the cave,
because they knew your genetic predisposition to trust the elders was going to be used against you.</p>
<p>That the world around you would not be the real world,
but rather the world that others want you to see.</p>
<p>Everyone benefits when you sit in that cave,
your cramming wasn’t a trick you invented.</p>
<p>The teacher made the curriculum incomprehensible on purpose,
to force you to memorize, it is easy and quick, and they get paid just the same.</p>
<p>Your textbooks are priced to extract the maximum possible price you can pay,
college loans are unforgivable by bankruptcy…</p>
<p>You will be paying them off, well into your 60s,
they will be extracted from your paycheck by a Judge’s order.</p>
<p>The classroom, is a cage, many have to ask for permission to use the restroom,
I bet you don’t have to do that in jail.</p>
<p>Those rows of students, aught to feel wrong,
like you are being hung out to dry.</p>
<p>The 45 minute or hour long periods,
prevent you from learning for real.</p>
<p>That you have multiple subjects in a day,
ensures you will never finish anything, just fudge and cram.</p>
<p>Nothing you will learn in High School will be useful to you in life,
it will feel that way…</p>
<p>But what you know, will be what you have learned on your own,
it is actually proof that you are brilliant, and the idea if genius is stupid.</p>
<p>And it should really bother you that standardized education, is the same for all,
but we each have different interests, and curiosities, and pressing questions.</p>
<p>The career is never guaranteed, you will have to fight liars fo it,
your crushing debt will make it a matter of survival.</p>
<p>And many of your interviews are going to be fake,
you will be used as filler material to meet a quota.</p>
<p>So that someone,
can get their family members in.</p>
<p>You see real education is self directed,
you have to choose what you learn and for how long.</p>
<p>Out minds need that,
in order to grow tiny brilliant ideas into large integrated systems.</p>
<p>Those are the contributions,
that will outlast you – you have to move in your own sequence, and at your own speed.</p>
<p>Just look at Newton, the apple might as well have fallen,
as he was thing about the curvature of the earth, while looking at the moon.</p>
<p>Asking, where would the apple go, if I threw it so hard,
that as it was pulled by gravity, earth’s curvature would counter that change.</p>
<p>Newton, pondering, orbital dynamics,
by shooting apples out of his cannon.</p>
<p>Initially your idea will be just as small,
but as you expand on it, you’ll invent the equivalent of calculus, to capture all the motion.</p>
<p>The allegory of the cave in one such idea that Plato worked on,
he brought Socrates into the story even.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your idea will be just as powerful,
just as precious to your students.</p>
<p>But you must learn for real to get there,
you have to listen to thousands of books on your trails, on your adventures, an in life.</p>
<p>Among countless many other things,
those books will being you into the culture of their authors.</p>
<p>The super culture, where you will eventually converge with others like you,
in wisdom.</p>
<p>The culture,
of greatness.</p>
