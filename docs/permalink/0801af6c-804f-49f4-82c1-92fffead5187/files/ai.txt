Write a romantic poem by Friedrich Nietzsche,
in a beautiful elaborate writing style that resembles his own.

Use his vocabulary and flow,
look deeply into his spirit and let him speak anew:

The poem is about an honest world,
a world where we can each grow to no end.

A world without chains poverty,
where no one is left behind.

A world without ineffective education,
where students learn for real growing in wisdom and greatness.

A world free from religion and gods,
where morality is born of dignity and love.

A world where we are free to travel,
and explore from Alps to Appalachia.

Where no one can threaten us,
because we can safely find a new home.

A world where we have tome to learn to compose,
to paint, to bodybuild and master machines.

A world with honest leaders that represent us,
through great wisdom and ,
foresight and not merely how they will look in books.

A beautiful and free world,
where every child learns to grow all the way upâ€¦

and become,
a great being.
