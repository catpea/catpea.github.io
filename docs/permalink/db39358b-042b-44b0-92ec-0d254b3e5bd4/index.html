<h2 id="notes-from-an-imaginary-high-school-a-quick-reminder">Notes from an Imaginary High School: A Quick Reminder</h2>
<p>We knew there was no conspiracy, no deliberate ill intent, no plan to<br>betray a student for a paycheck.</p>
<p>Many of the teachers were our friends, family, people we admired. Many felt<br>bad about the level of education we were receiving.</p>
<p>But, whether they liked it or not, consciously or subconsciously, at the<br>end of the day, it was clear that the teachers were forcing us to memorize<br>for long enough to pass standardized testing, and the administration didn't<br>have a problem with that.</p>

<h2 id="paved-with-good-intentions">Paved with Good Intentions</h2>
<p>They meant no harm, they did it so that they could get paid, so that the<br>school could get funding, so that everyone would keep their job. But those<br>who didn't rise against it caused harm. They interfered with our real<br>education, harming creativity, erasing individuality.</p>
<p>In K-12 they taught us that delicate hearts belonged with mommy at home,<br>that bullies were a fact, and life is never fair. They hurt our hearts, and<br>shamed us by saying. "Oh, just grow up, already! Because, you need to<br>improve your grades."</p>

<h2 id="we-were-mislead">We Were Mislead</h2>
<p>"Today, we'll get it all working, and today we'll get paid. Tomorrow,<br>tomorrow, when everything is worked-out and working, we'll get to the<br>students - one thing at a time." - They'd say.</p>
<p>But we knew that tomorrow never comes, once the new day starts, it is<br>already today. The tomorrow they thought of, was more of a garbage can for<br>nice-to-haves.</p>
<p>They were working very hard, and it was all very hard work. But they didn't<br>have the strength to do both, their job, and make schools work.</p>
<p>In effect, everyone forgot about us. They forgot we were the point and the<br>future. Their aim was no longer our education, but merely staying in<br>business by arranging for what in effect became, an impression of one.</p>
<h2 id="twists--turns">Twists &amp; Turns</h2>
<p>To accomplish all this, some changes needed to be made, they first<br>convinced themselves that they were doing a great job so as long as they<br>were working hard, and then some things needed to be taken away, and a few<br>needed to be twisted around.</p>
<p>We were forced to recognize that teachers work really, really hard, that<br>the administration works very hard, it is all hard work, extremely<br>stressful. People give up days off, cancel vacations, make sacrifices.</p>
<p>To question administration or teachers while they work that hard, makes for<br>a heartless, cruel, shameful petty little student.</p>

<h2 id="how-unfortunate">How Unfortunate...</h2>
<p>"Focus on the positive, on how hard we work and how far we've come<br>together." - They'd say, ever so lovingly.</p>
<p>Void of context, many of the shallow arguments the teachers made could<br>almost stand up to a proper debate.</p>
<p>But we remained unconvinced because teaching is not just a job. It is not<br>an ordinary job, and it is not just about knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="teaching-is-complex">Teaching is Complex</h2>
<p>Teaching requires that the Teacher first comprehends each of the Students,<br>understands their existing body of knowledge, manner of learning, and finds<br>a way to genuinely communicate with them.</p>
<p>Tracking is not that hard, a pencil or a Concept Mapping tool will do.</p>
<h4 id="concept-mapping-with-cmap">Concept Mapping with Cmap</h4><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22YeW55POBs" title="Play Video"><div class="p-md-5 m-xl-5 border-rounded"><img class="w-100 rounded shadow" src="files/yid-22YeW55POBs.jpg"></div></a></p>
<h2 id="teaching-is-complex-and-rewarding">Teaching is Complex and Rewarding</h2>
<p>Teaching should respectfully extend their existing knowledge. The teacher<br>must know if fascination with Dinosaurs will head towards Paleontology,<br>Biology, Ecology, and keep an eye on progression of that path (if said path<br>continues) to see is they have a Cell Bilogist, Astrobiologist,<br>Evolutionary Biologist, or maybe a Writer, in their class.</p>
<p>The complexity of teaching may actually scale with the reward, how<br>fantastic it must be to help our Dino Girl to ponder inter-planetary<br>cross-contamination from the Chicxulub crater and witness her journey lean<br>towards Astrobiology and an internship at NASA/ESA, possibly a career.</p>
<p>Now, pushing her away from what moves her, grading her down for it, and<br>forcing her to memorize whatever is in the curriculum so that she may pass<br>the grade. That is something else... And the answer to how many children<br>were hurt this way, is: <strong>all of them</strong>, in every school, on every<br>continent, in every country, state and district.</p>
<p>Schools interrupt education.</p>
<p>They destroy careers, passions, inspirations, talents, and genius. They do<br>it just a split second before the Kids know how to protect it.</p>
<p>They destroy The Shy, The Delicate, The Compassionate.</p>
<p>They destroy Pacifists, Leaders, Scientists, Inventors, Dreamers, Poets,<br>Artists, Sculptors, Musicians, Adventures, Writers, Makers, Heroes.</p>

<p>A picture of a real blackboard in a library taken from [F**k Grades by<br>Denise Dutton](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz-gVKwWNzs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xz-gVKwWNzs</a>).</p>
<p>Prof. Dutton does not postulate a 2.* GPA student in her talk.</p>
<p>I think the person that wrote this was a young woman. And this might have<br>been her last act of defiance in that school.</p>
<p>We lost a wise and delicate being, a leader, a scientist, maybe a writer,<br>to silence, rejection, shunning.</p>
<p>That late-night scribble is clear Evidence of Exceptional Ability. This is<br>someone we each admire, someone Beautifully Courageous.</p>
<p>But she left, she's gone. They gave her a 2.0 for Leadership,<br>Unbreakability, Heroism, for spending her last semester reading books she<br>loved, at the school library she loved, right before getting thrown out.</p>
<p>Thrown out by people that didn't know what they were doing, but they sure<br>as hell worked hard at doing it.</p>
<p>Thrown out for unobstructed pursuit of Wisdom.</p>
<h2 id="lux-et-veritas-enlightenment-and-authenticity">Lux Et Veritas (Enlightenment and Authenticity)</h2>
<p>Above all, school is a place of healing, it is a sacred place.</p>
<p>The School Library is even more sacred, it is a place for Young<br>Philosophers.</p>
<p>School is about safety and security and protection, first.</p>
<p>It must be a place where we can safely grow, study both Life, and Wisdom.<br>Search for Enlightenment and Authenticity.</p>
<p>Education is about mental health, learning to live.</p>
<p>Learning to avoid what is not life.</p>
<p>Not starting at zero, but rather resuming at where the greatest minds left<br>off.</p>
<p>The teachers were supposed to work for us first. Only upon genuinely<br>enabling us to comprehend new things, should they be rewarded.</p>
<h2 id="how-evil">How Evil...</h2>
<p>Alas, teaching whilst failing to educate, is fraud.</p>
<p>Parading the coffee lovers, who want to breeze through with a 4.0 GPA, to<br>get the hell out, and move past this damn charade. Parading them as<br>successfully educated students, is fraud.</p>
<p>Making the quiet girl cry because she wanted to comprehend and not merely<br>memorize, is evil.</p>
<p>Turning face away, when the fat kid is being bullied, beaten, assaulted,<br>threatened, kicked, held down, spat upon, is evil.</p>
<p>Sending a kid back home, when you just witnessed his father beating him in<br>the bathroom for the bad grades he ended up with, because he can't memorize<br>anything when he is under constant threat from everybody, is evil.</p>
<p>Failing to authentically educate, and then grading down those who rejected<br>the memorization dog and pony show, is evil.</p>
<p>Pretending to teach under the poisonous threat of repeating the grade or<br>year, semester or class, threatening kids to stop learning, and start<br>memorizing, is evil.</p>
<p>Sending kids home to angry, often violent parents, because they rejected<br>fake education, fake tests, fantasy GPA, is evil.</p>

<h2 id="we-were-all-geniuses-we-were-mislead">We Were All Geniuses, We Were Mislead</h2>
<p>We were taught that genius is rare, that creativity is reserved for those<br>who have talent, that good grades get a good job, that only the smart ace<br>the tests, and that to pass a test we need to cram harder and take more<br>notes, that grade-point-average is the measure of a human - because that is<br>how the world works.</p>
<p>And work...</p>
<p>Work would set us free.</p>
<p>We were scared, because there was no road ahead. There was no clear<br>authentic future.</p>
<p>Not without that same charade, that inauthenticity, that glass of fashion,<br>that mold of form that we were being pressed into, and everyone else<br>already accepted, and blindly participated in.</p>

<p>At first we thought we were the losers. We certainly had the grades to<br>prove it. We formed a club. We sarcastically called it The Breakfast Club<br>after an old movie. We expected to be held back, and eventually kicked out.</p>
<p>We didn't expect to be seen as the gifted ones.</p>
<p>But we had the gift of courage, the gift of search for a clear road ahead.<br>And that road turned out to be becoming a Businessperson, a Founder, a CEO.<br>It was a path that mixed education with rewards, leading onward to<br>independence and a majestic triumph, albeit through many a failure.</p>
<p>In school, we were being forced to memorize Trigonometry, Triceps and<br>Triceratops, when what we really needed was help with finding investors to<br>scale our little Breakfast Club business.</p>

<h2 id="the-courageous--the-fallen">The Courageous &amp; The Fallen</h2>
<p>The others secretly saw us as courageous, strong and unbreakable, healthy<br>and authentic. But they didn't really know how to relate to us. We were the<br>same but they were too confused by the noise of homework, quizzes, tests,<br>and grades, chores, parents, circles, and punishment, punishment everywhere.</p>
<p>The threat of repeating classes, reliving the same noise, or being held<br>back was exactly like prison. Neurologically, Threat and Punishment<br>interferes with Neurogenesis. For the most Delicate, it wasn't just<br>difficult to cram and memorize, it might have been neurologically<br>impossible.</p>

<p>The biggest of the troublemakers had the most brittle souls, they were the<br>first to shine, the mightiest of the thinkers, the best of the survivors,<br>but tragically also the first to have their spark dim under threat and<br>pressure.</p>
<p>Already forged in battle at home, the betrayal of schooling was the tipping<br>point for many.</p>
<p>They just couldn't resist parents, or pressure, or grades, not for that<br>long, it was not human to live perpetually frightened in constant fear.</p>
<p>The schools added to the dark forces already crushing them, the teachers<br>were supposed to kindle their flame, but they filled their vessel and often<br>extirpated their spark.</p>

<p>We'd see it the moment it happened, overnight they'd end up switching<br>crowds.</p>
<p>The teachers, who were supposed to be their protectors, and their hope and<br>inspiration, would eventually notice the transition as well, but perversely<br>they would think to themselves "I was correct, I always knew that one was a<br>loser too."</p>

<h2 id="people-tried-to-help-but-they-didnt-know-how">People tried to help, but they didn't know how.</h2>
<p>Someone said that the only reason the teachers seemed to know more than we<br>did, was because they had to regurgitate that same stuff every year to keep<br>their jobs...</p>
<p>Each time it came up; there was always someone to say that they wanted to<br>help us, but in the end they seemed to have wanted to assimilate and<br>destroy, embrace and extinguish. Get the gifted ones out of the system to<br>make things easier for themselves, to calm the waters - if nothing sticks<br>out, it must be all good.</p>
<p>Nobody, really, took grades seriously because of how easy it was to cram<br>before a test, pass it, and forget it. Since tests did not represent<br>student knowledge, grades did not represent the student. Everyone knew<br>this, nobody said anything because once the students realized the school<br>was mostly a charade they just wanted to graduate and move on.</p>
<p>Overwhelming majority of Teachers didn't want to change anything because<br>they didn't want to make their job any harder, they just want to get paid<br>and go home. Statistically half of them quit anyway.</p>
<p>Management was focused on grade points and funding.</p>
<p>Everybody else was parading solutions, but there was no time, any extras<br>were aimed at symptoms, extras just added to the weight of existing<br>problems.</p>
<p>The root cause was that we were not safe, and we were not learning.</p>

<p>The Investors sought Natural Born Leaders, they sought Evidence of<br>Exceptional Ability.</p>
<p>The Investors sought people who rejected the inauthenticity of broken<br>education and didn't partake in stupid charades.</p>
<p>It was almost like High School became a mechanism to keep the<br>administration busy, the teachers blind, the students poor, and the parents<br>dreaming.</p>

<p>Staying in school had a negative impact on our education, on our futures.<br>College and Premed brought sleep deprivation into the farce, it was a<br>dangerous joke.</p>

<p>Though we didn't believe in schools, we doubted ourselves for years. Now,<br>looking back, we searched for mentors, but none were to be found. But, in<br>the absence of teachers, we became the teachers.</p>
<p>To quote an old commercial: We were The Crazy Ones, The Misfits, The<br>Rebels, The Troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes, the ones who<br>saw things differently, who were not fond of rules, and had no respect for<br>the status quo.</p>
<p>We were the ones crazy enough to think we could change the world...</p>
<p>... and we did ...</p>
