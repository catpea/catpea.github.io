            <p>“No pain no gain” is a myth made up by bro science lords,
that visit the gym for a week each year, and muse poetic about their suffering.</p>
<p>The other myth of sets and reps plays into that as well,
nonsense like “lift to failure” or “super-sets” prevents a proper workout.</p>
<p>It will cause some temporary discomfort as it shuts you down,
way too early, preventing your body to swiftly adapting.</p>
<hr>
<p>Sure, it will hurt if you run into a wall head first,
but you also won’t achieve anything.</p>
<hr>
<p>And yes, the first week at the gym will ache as heck,
but only because your muscles were in a dormant state, a sickly state.</p>
<p>Once you awaken them,
you don’t even remember the pain of the first week or two.</p>
<p>Unless, week or two is all the working out you will do for that year,
but then you just trick yourself into thinking that working out is painful.</p>
<p>This is exactly the root of the “no pain, no gain” myth,
the initial aches fade away after a couple of weeks.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is another ache, and it comes from dehydration,
it is a charlie horse, except it may happen in your back.</p>
<p>A charlie horse in your back will hurt really bad,
but you still have to come to the gym, and do a micro motion workout.</p>
<p>First of all, you need a bed with lifted back and feet, like in hospitals,
what is good for the recovering back surgery patient is good for you.</p>
<p>Then you pull your self out on a chain,
and kind of belly dance, then you make your way back to the gym.</p>
<p>And micro dance with light dumbbells,
you have to keep going until your back warms up.</p>
<p>And here your range of motion will increase every day,
and your back may let you go just after three days.</p>
<p>Get a blood pressure monitor before adding electrolytes to your diet,
make sure that it works by testing your blood pressure at a pharmacy.</p>
<p>And then add  vegetable juice to your diet,
making sure that your blood pressure does not rise.</p>
<hr>
<p>There are millions of reasons for aches, of all different kinds,
but I would say the big reason for back pain.</p>
<p>Is sleeping on a flat bed while being obese,
you need a hospital bed, and a daily workout to get the fat out of your body.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is another kind of pain,
the really stupid kind.</p>
<p>I can lift 30 pounds per hand to the beat of very slow songs,
but that is 60 pounds on my spine area, it is stupid to even try.</p>
<p>When you lift 5 pounds per hand, that is only 10 pounds,
that is the weight you lose by the time you can lift 5 pounds for an hour.</p>
<p>10 pounds vs 60 pounds, is a 50 pound difference,
and I would call that sever danger and stupid, reckless.</p>
<p>The army has people running with 40 pound packs,
the firefighters, should be able to carry the weight of a man in some gear.</p>
<p>But that eats away at your health, this is what you are getting paid for,
back problems, bad knees, strange aches.</p>
<p>At the gym, you are meant to lift towards health,
not towards spending your body.</p>
<hr>
<p>I don’t know what the limits are exactly,
but if you gradually increase your weights over the course of a couple of years.</p>
<p>From 3 pounds for an hour non-stop, to 5 for two hours, to 8 for three hours,
then to 10 for three hours, and then 15 maybe for four hours…</p>
<p>Your body will tell you to just stay where you are,
you probably won’t want to lift 20 pounds per hand.</p>
<p>And in addition to that, the higher you go in weight,
the less fat you burn.</p>
<p>At 5 pounds of no stop dancing, you are on firer,
but at 15 you are no longer moving as quickly as you can with 5 pounds.</p>
<p>You are lifting fewer times, burning less fat,
and putting on more muscle.</p>
<hr>
<p>And, there is the injury kind of pain,
and you can heal while working out by going around it.</p>
<p>By switching to a slightly different routine,
this works well for shoulder blades, but not so good for your feet.</p>
<p>I hurt my foot, and hoping that it would go away,
I took a half dose of a popular anti-ache medicine for a few days.</p>
<p>And while why foot did not hurt as much,
all I was doing, is preventing the injury from healing.</p>
<p>The nature of this injury was that I was dancing with dumbells,
for two hours, always, always, always, leading with my right foot.</p>
<p>I only learned the dance move on the right side of my body,
one of my feet was getting more banged up than the other.</p>
<p>The solution to that,
is practicing the dance move with the other foot as primary.</p>
<p>So now, I am able to dance leading with left and right foot,
and I am able to spread out the pressure, letting one foot rest.</p>
<hr>
<p>Stomach ache, comes from cheap protein,
that contains lactose.</p>
<p>Even if you are lactose tolerant,
there may be initial discomfort, from introducing lactose, and shifting your diet.</p>
<p>You need to keep testing out different protein products,
the lactose content will vary, the smart manufacturer will remove it.</p>
<p>Overall,
you can just get your protein from some meat and peanuts.</p>
<p>Vegetarian protein however is expensive,
so that would call for supplementation with the powdered one.</p>
<p>The serving size is based on your weight, so it is very inaccurate,
you just have have to figure out what works.</p>
<p>If you are large, you already have muscles,
you need to burn the fat.</p>
<p>If you are eating protein because it tastes like candy,
you need to rethink your diet, eat some lean meat.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, blisters, first of all, they happen initially,
and don’t really repeat.</p>
<p>So it is like your skin getting used to a more active lifestyle,
but bad shoes will get you anyway.</p>
<p>You can try thick winter socks for hunters,
to protect your foot from the shoe, but that will result tin moisture.</p>
<p>Dancing with dumbbells for three hours,
while wearing thick wet socks, will get you somehow.</p>
<p>Recognize three features that all shoes have,
and get the combination right.</p>
<p>A shoe with a large or wide toe box,
may actually prevent your toes from having any contact with the shoe.</p>
<p>Zero drop shoes, have no heat, they are flat,
and that means you won’t strike your ankle while dancing.</p>
<p>A high heal, as you may see in foam sole shoes,
will very often hurt you in days, it will cause a heel bump, a deformity.</p>
<p>Please, trim your foot claws,
to protect them from getting pulled up by your socks during exercise.</p>
<p>And if you do lose one,
always have an ingrown toenail kit on you.</p>
<p>Ingrown toenails happen because when you lose your first toenail,
the skin around it will gently collapse.</p>
<p>The new toenail growing back, will now bite into that skin,
make suer that it has a smooth ride, that it will slowly push against the collapsed skin.</p>
<p>Be careful when mixing jogging and bodybuilding by means of dancing with dumbbells,
because blisters from the new routine you are adding, may halt the other.</p>
<p>And lastly, bodybuilding is an endurance activity,
where you start with tree pounds for 15 minutes…</p>
<p>And gradually increase your endurance to lift for an hour or more,
non-stop and start increasing the dumbbell weight.</p>
<p>The longer the workout, the louder the message and quicker the results,
the heavier the dumbbells the bigger the muscles.</p>
<p>You get two gadgets that help you in your exercise,
a vibrating interval timer that will gradually help you get to the full hour workout.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1DAmmROUX8">And music, that when fresh, will bring you, distraction, and energy</a>,
enter a dance trance, by simply lifting to the beats of songs.</p>
<p>Sets and reps, super-sets, are all just bro science,
the fundamental model for bodybuilding is jogging with progressivelly heavier dumbbells.</p>
