            <p>Studies have shown that muscle hypertrophy (growth) can occur with lower weights if the training volume is high enough. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25853914/">A landmark study by Schoenfeld et al. (2016) demonstrated that both high-load (heavy weights) and low-load (light weights) training can lead to similar hypertrophic outcomes when training volume is equated</a>.</p>
<p>Muscle growth is primarily driven by mechanisms such as muscle tension, metabolic stress, and muscle damage. High-repetition, low-weight training creates significant metabolic stress and muscle fatigue, which are known to contribute to hypertrophy. This is supported by research from Brad Schoenfeld and others, indicating that these mechanisms are effective in stimulating muscle growth.</p>
<p>Evidence suggests that increased training volume (total amount of weight lifted across sets and repetitions) can enhance muscle growth. High-intensity, multi-hour training typically involves a large volume of work, which can be beneficial for hypertrophy. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9302196/">A study by Krieger (2010) found that higher volumes of resistance training were associated with greater increases in muscle mass</a>.</p>
<p>The muscle&#39;s ability to adapt to different types of stress is well-documented. High-repetition training can lead to increased endurance and muscle resilience, which supports the overall muscle-building process. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17326698/">Research by Wernbom et al. (2007) shows that training with high repetitions and moderate to low loads can result in substantial muscle growth over time</a>.</p>
<p>High-intensity, high-volume training can improve insulin sensitivity and recovery, which can indirectly support muscle growth. Studies have shown that improved metabolic health and faster recovery can enhance training effectiveness and muscle development.</p>
<p>Some studies comparing different training modalities have shown that while heavy weights are more efficient for strength gains, lighter weights with high repetitions are effective for muscle growth. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4214965/">A study by Radaelli et al. (2014) highlighted that lighter weights with high repetitions were comparable to heavier weights for muscle growth</a>, especially when the training was performed to near failure.</p>
<p>Many bodybuilders and athletes use high-volume, low-weight training methods to induce muscle growth and endurance. These practical examples align with scientific findings and provide additional support for this training approach.</p>
<p>Afterword</p>
<p>If you do the same thing you have always done,
you will get the same thing you always got.</p>
<p>I want you to know that we don&#39;t really need reasearch and hard science,
because no one will be able to quantum leap from max sets and reps of max weight, to five pounds higher.</p>
<p>Don’t point to people who spent most of their lives lifting light,
and are trying to show you that are a golden child champion.</p>
<p>People who depend on lies, will lie,
and those who hope to compete against liars will become liars.</p>
<p>You want to win that medal?
Guess ho you are up against.</p>
<p>So all your heroes, fake natties included,
are not a source of truth, or hope, or inspiration.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your champions,
do not inspire me.</p>
<hr>
<p>But I would like to inspire you,
to becoming a champion, instead of worshiping them.</p>
<p>Better than a champion,
the beast in the area.</p>
<p>For whom medals,
do not count.</p>
<hr>
<p>Bodybuilding in a gradual endurance sport,
it goes from cradle to the grave.</p>
<p>And the point is no more,
than having done it.</p>
<hr>
<p>And to do it,
you start slow.</p>
<p>Humbly,
in the beginning.</p>
<p>With three pound dumbbells,
taste the ridicule, use it.</p>
<p>For all the compromises that take from good and give to evil,
all evil directed at you, it is good and helthy energy.</p>
<p>And if you start looking too serious,
stop looking like everyone else.</p>
<p>You do not want to succeed,
by dressing like the people who laugh at you.</p>
<p>Let them hide in the shadows,
you are not part of their world.</p>
<p>You are there to start and finish,
not to sit and be perfect like everyone else.</p>
<p>You are meant to grow all the way up,
until you become a great being.</p>
<p>There is no time to sit,
there is no time to rest during a workout.</p>
<p>When you order a burger, and get an empty bag with some crumbs,
do you call it a job well done, or go back and get your burger?</p>
<p>When you spend 55 minus sitting,
and the rest of your stay barely doing anything.</p>
<p>That is not a workout,
that is going to the gym to rest.</p>
<p>Which is fine, but don’t call it a workout,
don’t get mad is someone says that few minutes of lifting is not enough.</p>
<hr>
<p>And then there is injury, muscle isolation may just mean,
your back, or legs, will forever remain weak.</p>
<p>Lifting heavy may mean hurt muscles,
downtime.</p>
<hr>
<p>And to be honest, even the scientists,
maybe confused here a tiny bit.</p>
<p>They may not fully comprehend the girth of an arm,
gained from high volume.</p>
<p>They may gloss over bodybuilding,
never quite having seen arms the size of legs.</p>
<p>When they say some heavy, and a lot of light are somewhat equal,
they may not be evaluating all variables.</p>
<p>Such as how long it takes for big muscles to become strong,
and how quickly those who only lift heave lose all their strength after injury.</p>
<p>They may forget that that lifting light a lot, makes the full body bloom,
and lifting heavy a little, does not make person as flexible, or maybe even as healthy.</p>
<p>The debate between the two styles, would need to show two images,
but not just of the bodies, but longevity, frequency of injury.</p>
<p>And how often the two styles succeed to meet their goals,
and how well do they feel throughout, both mentally and physically.</p>
<hr>
<p>For those of us who have very low standards, and intelligence,
your weight is bigger than mine, but my results will be bigger than yours.</p>
<hr>
<p>All I am asking you,
is to stop lifting for 30 seconds, and sitting for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I am asking you to begin walking for 30 minutes,
and then start lightly jogging.</p>
<p>And then lightly jogging...
with 3 pound dumbbells in your hands.</p>
<p>And then lightly jogging with three pounds for 45 minutes,
and then with 5 pounds, and later for an hour.</p>
<p>And once you have your hard earned hour,
protect it, synchronize with slow beat music.</p>
<p>And then start lifting seven and a half pounds,
non stop to the beat of your slow playlists, as you extend your daily training to two hours.</p>
<p>And then ten pounds, and fifteen, and seventeen and a half,
And then 20.</p>
<p>Back down to lower weight,
as you exten your training to three hours.</p>
<p>And work your way back up,
to 20 pounds, for three hours straight now.</p>
<p>Now glance at the new comers,
the heavly lifters.</p>
<p>The best of them will lift 20 pounds for almost three minutes,
you will lift 20 pounds for three hours.</p>
<hr>
<p>Do you think your body will weaken, whither, hurt,
or adapt, as gradually as you are challenging yourself.</p>
<p>Do you think lifting heavy for a little while,
will induce body adaptation past the initial awakening to general activity?</p>
<p>Or once unfurled from a bad lifestyle,
will your body dip into a plateau for having maxed out.</p>
<p>Without the ability,
to gently extend duration, weight, and tempo.</p>
<hr>
<p>The worst thing about my claims, may just be,
that lifting heavy is harder, and the adaption is slower.</p>
<p>Lifting light to the beat of music, munching on trailmix,
and enjoying an injury free dumbbell dance…</p>
<p>Feels great,
it is fun.</p>
