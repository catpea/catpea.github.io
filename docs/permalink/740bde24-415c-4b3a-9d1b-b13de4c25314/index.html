            <p>I know you tried and tried other stuff, but this works because of music trance,
that you enter by lifting to the beat of slow songs for an hour or more.</p>
<p>Which under dance trance feel like 20 minutes,
and your energy comes from trail mix, just peanuts and dried fruit, no candy.</p>
<p>Long distance hikers don’t always realize that switching to trail mix diet,
gives them super endurance, because they are stuffed with complex carbs.</p>
<p>That means they are always being fed by their system,
they never hit any walls, energy is always there.</p>
<p>Make your own trail-mix please, make sure that extra sugar is not added,
and I highly recommend you soak it in initially hot water overnight.</p>
<p>This will protect your dental work, and perhaps, and this is a guess,
this could add to your hydration, and will not contribute to dehydration.</p>
<hr>
<p>Both, dance trance, slow songs at first and faster as you get stronger,
and trail mix, maybe with a sprinkle of protein powder, but count your calories…</p>
<p>Give you a push forward, that you have not received in any other workout,
so this will really work out.</p>
<p>And the workout scales from a hint of muscle like you would see in a model,
all the way way up to huge muscles, that would allow you to compete.</p>
<hr>
<p>However, what you are about to hear is just about the opposite,
of what everyone else will tell you, and they will be very convincing and passionate.</p>
<p>However, their heavy sets-an-reps workout comes at a price,
it is 10 times slower to grow muscle their way.</p>
<p>They are passionate about it, because they know that it works,
but they don’t know that sets, reaps, and rest is the slow way to grow muscle.</p>
<hr>
<p>My proof for you is in a thought experiment,
imagine you just inherited a fine horse, from a distant uncle.</p>
<p>The breed has been known to win competitions,
but you are not sure how, so you sit down to figure it out.</p>
<p>Will you do sets and reps, where you walk the horse with some heavy weights,
for one minute, and then rest for maybe 10 minutes, as the weight really is a lot.</p>
<p>What could you achieve at the end of they year?
How are you going to increase weights, when everything is in 5 or 10 pound increments.</p>
<p>If you already lift heavy, then adding 5 pounds,
will crush your horse even sooner, and it will nedd to rest longer.</p>
<p>And probably, bite you,
in the process - which frankly is kind of a magical woo-woo magic, isn’t it?</p>
<p>It is taken from some bodybuilder movies,
where they are just showing off to camera.</p>
<hr>
<p>Or will you accept the responsibility for building a workout for your horse,
actually strategize…</p>
<p>And based on the way that you have seen,
the horses and your own muscles grow?</p>
<p>So a non woo-woo workout takes what you got,
and repeats it under more weight, to get more of what you got.</p>
<p>Both you and the horse have considerable muscles on your legs,
you have to optimize the process that got you those.</p>
<p>That means walking, for an extended duration,
with progressively heavier weights.</p>
<p>But no so much weight, that you have to stop,
and neither so little weight that you can lift more.</p>
<p>If you can make it though your workout with more weight,
then you should add more weight, but not so much that you stop.</p>
<p>There is one exception, and that is when you want to lose fat,
here you don’t lift your maximum, but use that to move faster.</p>
<p>And a good measuring stick to how wast is fast,
is when you are breathing heavily.</p>
<p>If you are not breathing heavily,
then that means your workout playlist is too slow.</p>
<p>And it is only good for rest,
you need to find faster songs, if you want to burn fat.</p>
<hr>
<p>This workout has a very easy beginning, and you would think,
that this would cause some delay in muscle growth, but it doesn’t.</p>
<p>Any movement near your maximum for extended durations,
will use fat and trail mix for energy, and peanuts and other protein for muscle.</p>
<p>This is a standing dumbbell workout, that looks similar to 1980s aerobics,
you won’t be able to have that range of motion though.</p>
<p>They are burning fat and not paying attention to muscle,
you are lifting hard, for extended durations.</p>
<p>If you are skinny the workout is one hour long, and non stop,
if you are large it is two or three hours long.</p>
<p>And you can’t fling weights, can’t swing them on your joints,
you have to notice you muscles straining and getting tired.</p>
<hr>
<p>Please know that first few weeks, getting your muscles to do new things,
will cause discomfort, but this is temporary.</p>
<p>This is such a small potato, that fit people don’t really remember,
their initial body aches.</p>
<p>You should view them as a nuisance, and not really the fault of a workout,
but your fault for not being fit, if I may.</p>
<p>Getting over the initial aches, also puts your body in a stronger state,
where you are less likely to hurt you back or have weird pains.</p>
<p>You simply become more flexible,
and gain little muscles to support your fitness.</p>
<hr>
<p>Like joggers, at first, you won’t be able to make it through the full hor non stop,
get a free interval time app, and figure out your rest and workout periods.</p>
<p>And then focus on eliminating rest a little bit at a time,
I highly recommend being mathematically precise, as it makes eliminating rest easy.</p>
<p>And you will have to work out 5 to 7 days a week,
trail mix will prevent you from getting tired.</p>
<p>But eat just enough to have energy, similar to how marathoners eat their gels,
before and maybe during a workout, trailmix is slow to digest though.</p>
<p>You must start in the beginning with the lightest dumbbells,
again, that aren’t too light, but also don’t ruin your exercise.</p>
<p>Maybe consider practicing moving back and forth with 3 pound dumbbells,
and then temporary adding 5 until you get tired and need to go back to 3.</p>
<p>In case you need two, I am sure if the gym does not have 2 pound weights,
they will get them for you or let you bring in your won.</p>
<p>The gym is not the best place for what is almost dancing with dumbbells,
consider parks where people do their morning walking, or a lake if you got one.</p>
<p>Figure out where the non-gym people sneak away,
and go join them for their walks with dumbbells.</p>
<p>Finally, the dumbbells allow you multiple exercises,
and influence your entire body, shoulders biceps, your back, legs and abdominals.</p>
<p>You can curl for biceps, lift palm down for shoulders and back,
and above your head to rest your arms, and focus on your back.</p>
<p>This multi exercise, while walking, especially in nature,
integrates really well with dance trance, while supporting fat loss.</p>
<p>You barely move to switch to a new exercise,
and you should do a dance move when switching.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can add bicycling for legs,
jogging with dumbbells for you back and overall health.</p>
<p>Hiking to strengthen your back overall figure,
and wisdom, greatness and and philosophy.</p>
<p>When hiking, or even bicycling, you should switch from music,
to narrated books, which is story telling trance, without the rhythmic beat.</p>
<p>Don’t lift too heavy,
and always drink plenty of water.</p>
<p>Lastly, if you get brain fog or tiredness,
that just means you are not eating enough trail mix.</p>
