            <p>Let us examine roots and gravity of young wisdom,<br>that which we come across, when we are still children.</p>
<hr>
<p>My first wisdom was in how I faced violence,<br>I nobly took no part in it, I only pushed people back, I never became like they were.</p>
<p>And right here,<br>we have a wisdom that we can examine.</p>
<hr>
<p>My main bully was twisted and cunning,<br>likely instructed by his father.</p>
<p>We used to be school friends,<br>and then he started fighting me for no reason.</p>
<p>He didn&#39;t just attack me,<br>but turned everyone against me.</p>
<p>He was probably a puppet,<br>in his father&#39;s sick game.</p>
<p>And if not, then pretending to be hurt by someone,<br>was maybe his way of making friends.</p>
<p>I remember when he was forced to share his glue in 4th grade,<br>when he got back a mangled tube he cried that his father would beat him.</p>
<hr>
<p>The change in that boy was irreversible,<br>his attacks continued, and at least in my view they were elaborate.</p>
<p>This is a young person,<br>who became completely unreachable, and incapable of reason, possibly emotion.</p>
<p>He was a normal person at first,<br>but then became warped, and to me he became a monster.</p>
<p>Whatever happened to him in the span of a day or two,<br>happened because he was too young to see he was being manipulated or warped.</p>
<p>If that event could have been prevented,<br>he would continue growing up like a normal boring person.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even though this was fourth grade,<br>we were perfectly capable of spotting trouble.</p>
<p>Whatever got him, was invisible to him,<br>his father most likely, used his lack of experience to warp him.</p>
<p>As he started making friends and perhaps spreading whatever lies about me,<br>it was more advantageous to him to remain a bully that plays a victim.</p>
<p>His father was no longer needed,<br>he entered a different life line.</p>
<hr>
<p>He and his friends, eventually got caught lying,<br>and the school psychologist who intervened in me pushing him away the last time.</p>
<p>Cracked the case, as two of his friends were supporting his side of the story,<br>and she made them confess the truth.</p>
<p>The young Psychologist woman came into the class room,<br>put her hand on my shoulder and said everything is going to be OK.</p>
<p>But my class was manipulated by the boy,<br>few minutes later, one of the smart girls that I grew up with said that they didn&#39;t want me in the class room.</p>
<p>They saw me as the bully that starts fights,<br>the final skirmish begun as I was trying to save the class comedian from getting beat up.</p>
<p>To my surprise both of them started fighting me,<br>and the main bully joined in.</p>
<p>I grew up surrounded by bullies,<br>I had no trouble getting them away from me.</p>
<hr>
<p>The friends of the bully got together few days later,<br>and started kicking and spitting on me on our way back from school.</p>
<p>It was between eight and twelve of them,<br>as I was getting up maybe for the fourth time as they kept pushing me off balance.</p>
<p>With the concrete of the sidewalk digging into my fists,<br>I understood how powerful I have become for not fighting them back.</p>
<p>To me they were opportunistic predators,<br>some would come to kick when I was down others waited to knock me down again.</p>
<p>Eventually they got tired,<br>and allowed me to walk away without anymore shoving.</p>
<p>I took a different path,<br>and started crying, not because I was hurt, but because how alone I was.</p>
<hr>
<p>The main bully had another wave come in,<br>this time it was older kids that were five years older.</p>
<p>They made a circle around me and one of them kicked me in the head,<br>it was a spin kick no doubt, it didn&#39;t hurt.</p>
<p>But fighting older kids that I have not really seen before,<br>and seeing that they had outside clothes on, I stayed down.</p>
<p>No one came to help, the girls saw the whole thing bu they didn&#39;t come to help,<br>I think everyone was just sacred of older kids.</p>
<p>I wasn&#39;t hurt, I was just not moving,<br>this was Russian language class, and the teacher was mad that I was late.</p>
<hr>
<p>I stopped going to school as to me it became a circus,<br>then after few months I go punished and graduated fine, as the teachers didn&#39;t wan trouble.</p>
<hr>
<p>Even though I lacked experience,<br>I still did all the right things.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t attack back, I stayed down,<br>when I could smell a knife in the skinhead-jacket pocket of one of the bullies.</p>
<p>And set myself free from school,<br>by becoming a student of pixel art.</p>
<p>I spent my time away from school at the biggest arcade in the city,<br>I didn&#39;t have money to play, but I loved watching other people play.</p>
<p>My favorite games were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LhEovW4Uqw">Asterix &amp; Obelix</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9DE-KyZnLc">The Simpsons</a>,<br>I liked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eh417JtLm8">Blanka from Street Fighter II</a>, and I liked how technical Streetfighter was.</p>
<p>When Wolfenstein 3D came out in Poland,<br>I was not impressed, 3D graphics destroyed Pixel Art, but Pixel Art will rule again someday.</p>
<hr>
<p>I had to make a choice to break away from everyone else,<br>as they were sick, or mislead.</p>
<p>The boys in my class wanted to keep together,<br>sometime after the event I described, I&#39;ve noticed them role playing boxing.</p>
<p>They asked me if I wanted to fight too,<br>they were now honorable fighters in their head.</p>
<p>They kept together, because nobody want to be alone,<br>b8ut that also meant that they were reinforcing each other&#39;s behavior; rather than acting on their wisdom.</p>
<hr>
<p>Where I experienced power, strengths, wisdom and independence,<br>they were not growing up correctly, they were drifting in the direction of where the group was going.</p>
<p>Sometimes I consider if mandatory military service that we had back then,<br>actually fueled violent behavior, in preparation for what seemed like more violence, but parents were causing most of the harm.</p>
<p>I remember I had a choke hold put on me by another friend,<br>but I had no interest in hurting him to get out, his father who beat him with the hose from the washer, was teaching him how to fight.</p>
<p>I probably caused the situation, but inflicting pain was not a healthy response on his part,<br>some years earlier he said that he wished he grew up watching horror movies so that he had no fear.</p>
<p>There was another boy who was violent but never towards me, when his father found out that his grades were bad,<br>he took him to girls&#39; restroom and beat him up - his personality change was instant - it was very visible and painful to watch even then.</p>
<p>I remember him stealing stuff after that,<br>his father ruined his mind - though I think he is a good person now.</p>
<hr>
<p>I would have ran to help him if I was wiser,<br>if back then I knew what I know now, I would have sprinted to attack his father, to stop the boy from becoming a thief.</p>
<p>With all I have learned from the bullies,<br>I would take him down by sliding into his feat and punching his nose, really hard, as I was no stranger to nosebleeds.</p>
<p>I&#39;d tell the police that his father was hurting him,<br>and I was just protecting him.</p>
<hr>
<p>That&#39;s probably why the girls didn&#39;t need much convincing that I was a bully,<br>I was breaking up fights, to get the bullies to stop hurting people because I sensed what it meant, and I saw bullies make bullies.</p>
<p>But it wasn&#39;t fighting,<br>just pushing the red faced snarling beasts back.</p>
<hr>
<p>Do you now remember how there are these tiny events when we are young,<br>that dictate all the rest of our lives ahead?</p>
<p>That&#39;s wisdom; not philosophy, education, schooling, cultures, heritage,<br>but the most powerful force there is: wisdom.</p>
<p>It comes from our warrior nature,<br>but then it flourishes and grows to make us Great And Peaceful Philosophers.</p>
<p>It is easily stunted by group think,<br>by doing what others do to satay with them as friend.</p>
<hr>
<p>But more than that, these tiny events in our youth also often mark points of no return,<br>at least not for a long while.</p>
<p>I see myself as nothing if I took the disgusting path to be friends with the bullies,<br>who later ended up attacking one of the special needs girls, and again the other girls barely raised their voice, to their credit I remember it being raised.</p>
<p>Hopefully they figured out the cool boys were monsters,<br>and to stay safe and away from them, and and protect their sister, special needs does not mean that someone is broken, just that they need real friends.</p>
<hr>
<p>I felt like an outsider, I didn&#39;t know I belonged anywhere,<br>I didn&#39;t know I could find that Psychologist lady that helped a year or two before to rain her amazing wrath, I didn&#39;t know to become friends with the Principal, or call the Police.</p>
<p>I trust the girls that I grew up with to take care of her,<br>I just know they looked after her, we were a family together for almost a decade.</p>
<p>When I left for America,<br>I was glad to leave the bullies behind.</p>
<p>There was one more bully in Brooklyn,<br>but having watched NYPD Blue, I knew I could call the police, and to tell then not to press charges.</p>
<p>NYPD broke up the gang,<br>the mothers stepped in.</p>
<p>And right before I came to Michigan,<br>the bully barely whimpered &quot;Fuck Poles&quot;.</p>
<p>He was not racist, he was just made sick,<br>he didn&#39;t hate white people, so he picked the Polish people to hate something.</p>
<hr>
<p>He too had a an opportunity to go to the Library and search for wisdom,<br>rather than going to the boxing club to get good at fighting.</p>
<p>In the 20 minute walk back from school,<br>he punched me maybe four times in the back of my head, full force, full theatrics.</p>
<p>Once we made it to the street we lived on,<br>I finally turned around to his punches.</p>
<p>I was ignoring them before, as I became an artist when it came to bullies,<br>we were maybe seventeen or so, and his boxing instructor was, bad.</p>
<p>He opened up with a full volley with punches to my face,<br>it only made it red for long enough for NYPD Blue to get a full picture of what they need to do.</p>
<hr>
<p>Like the bullies in Poland,<br>this boy needed wisdom.</p>
<p>When his brother or cousin, or mad uncle was saying white people are crazy but poles are worse,<br>he needed to walk away from that conversation.</p>
<p>Better yet,<br>here is what he needed to say to his stupid uncles face:</p>
<p>Out of the night that covers me,<br>Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br>I thank whatever ides may be<br>For my unconquerable soul.</p>
<p>In the fell clutch of circumstance<br>I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br>In the bludgeonings of chance<br>My head is bloodied, but unbowed.</p>
<p>Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br>Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br>And yet the menace of the years<br>Finds and shall find me unafraid.</p>
<p>It matters not how narrow the gate,<br>How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>I am the master of my fate,<br>I am the captain of my soul.</p>
<p>In a a way all this boy needed was a poem,<br>a thing that would help him grow the necessary wisdom against hate.</p>
<hr>
<p>My bullies were monsters,<br>but they didn&#39;t hate, they relished inflicting pain, but they had no hate in them.</p>
<p>This boy,<br>did get poisoned by it.</p>
<p>I think the police to underline the gravity of the situation,<br>never told him I didn&#39;t press the charges, but just kind of left it hanging in the air.</p>
<p>Hate of any kind of group of people as a teenager,<br>is a lot of evil to handle.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rejection of hate requires a culture of wisdom very early on,<br>a young person must immediately reject divisions.</p>
<p>In that case by Brooklyn Bully,<br>could chose to reject the family members that propagated hate, or permanently become a hater.</p>
<p>Though his Mom would be proud,<br>the path of rejection of hate and division could make him an outcast.</p>
<p>From the perspective of old man him,<br>he only had one real choice, Become a Philosopher, and and make those who spread hate the outcasts.</p>
<p>He needed to become someone capable of inspiring his family to Wisdom,<br>and away from that which is not worthy of us.</p>
<p>He had an opportunity to become a Philosopher, and change the world,<br>but he became a bully, that to me, is a big of a tragedy as the friend who got beat up by his father and instantly warped.</p>
<hr>
<p>Do you see,<br>and are you able to see it in the strangers you came across in your lives.</p>
<p>They are being pushed,<br>because they lack wisdom and experience.</p>
<p>The trick made by a family member looking for affirmation to their own hate,<br>or looking to simplify their own life.</p>
<hr>
<p>I believe that every violent person,<br>had an opportunity to become a Philosopher, but it was stolen from them.</p>
<p>Violence, Division, and especially Hate,<br>are so incredibly alien to us, that it is like breathing toxic air.</p>
<p>Those things do not emerge in children,<br>they are put there, and always deliberately.</p>
<p>It takes root because like cults it holds answers,<br>plugging up questions, and offering a target for hate.</p>
<p>Long before a child is made ill by a broken, mind warping idea,<br>there is a long stretch of time when they are more than capable of comprehending Greatness.</p>
<p>Restraint, Dignity, Nobility, Unbreakability, Fortitude, Courage, Honor, Love;<br>and Insight; and Foresight; and Understanding; and Authenticity; and Heroism.</p>
<p>These are the ideas, that when taught early on,<br>will immunize against the easier wrong, and bring a young person a feeling of ennoblement for choosing the harder right.</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,<br>we are not divided, we are not different, we are one family.</p>
<p>We are to repair schools, and end poverty,<br>and prevent the propagation of broken ideas that only give an impression of answers while keeping a person imprisoned within the invisible walls of hate.</p>
<p>Walls that prevent a person&#39;s Wisdom and Greatness,<br>from ever reaching the heights that are worthy of them.</p>
<p>We are one,<br>one family under the sun.</p>
